please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
others.

This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.

===================================
* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent

The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
http://64.78.49.204/

The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).

The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.

Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
beginning of the book.

The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
appear in December.

===================================
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow

Available at:
http://64.78.49.204/

Subject: NEWS: GNU/DEVELOPMENT... intl orgns take a close look at GNU/Linux
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:42 GMT

GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX

>From Frederick Noronha

INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
immense promise it holds out to the Third World.

But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? 

>From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
earnings.

United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
<radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.

infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
both the public and private sector.

This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
e-Government and related fields.

Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.

ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.

See http://www.egovos.org/

OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
======================

Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
tools. 

Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. 

It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.

UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information
Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
and culture.

It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for "revising,
updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal" as well as for
including new basic documents. 

"This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"
said Dauphin. 

Check out the sites at

UNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/)
UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/)
UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)
UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)

NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
======================

Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. 

CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
(GPL license). 

See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml

Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
related issues.

"We want to see how we can further this cause in the region," APDIP's Shahid
Akhtar told this correspondent.

Niranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based
in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
"Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries".

This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.

This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
and lives of these countries.

CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
======================

In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. 

Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.

Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.

Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
varsities, military installations and within government. 

Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
government sector.

On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
news.

GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)

"The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
to the Internet and use technology more effectively," says Dirk Slater
<dirk@welfarelaw.org>. 

While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. 

Despite many "digital divide" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
in low-income communities, access is still an issue. 

Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
homes. 

LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.

"We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.

LINC protagonists say they had also been "troubled" by the frequent problems
that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. "Giving
a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
projects but had limited success," says Slater. 

LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
organizations that LINC serves. 

"Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
details of our experiences for others doing similar projects," LINC
explains.

LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.

Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
support.

"We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
effectively," said Slater.

To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC
Project Linux pages at <http://www.lincproject.org/toolkit/linux>

NEED TO NETWORK
===============

Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.

Says Pillai: "The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. 

"Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
more symbiosis with them," says he. 

Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
"http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines," says he. 

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. "Do look
for symbiosis opportunities there too," he suggests. 

"I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
work and get fruits out faster," he adds.

Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT

Dear friends,

Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? 

Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.

Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 

It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN

ASK THE FOOL

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 

A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, "direct mail") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request.

YOUR MONEY 

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072

3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074

5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075

alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your 
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHT

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.

Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

COMMUNITY TIPS

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 

Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

Kevin "Free Kevin" Mitnick and Steve "Woz" Wozniak co-hosted an episode of The 
Screen Saver on Tech TV, where Woz autographed one of the laptops that Kevin 
got arrested for using. Now that machine, signed by both net-celebs, is up for 
sale on eBay. 

    This is the Toshiba Satellite T1960CS, 486 laptop computer seized by the 
    FBI on February 15, 1995, in Raleigh, NC, during the arrest of the world's 
    most celebrated computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick. The laptop is working and 
    has been loaded with a fresh version of Windows 95. A shrink-wrapped 
    version of Windows 95 on floppy, is included with the laptop. The laptop is 
    a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T 14.4 PCMCIA 
    modem card, power adapter and documentation in FBI evidence bags. The 
    laptop has been signed on the bottom by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple 
    Computer, and says, "You've got the whole world in your hands. --Woz (Free 
    Kevin!). It is also signed by Mitnick himself. The system was shown on the 
    September 27, 2002 episode of The Screen Savers on TechTV, where the

                 Do You Want To Teach and Grow Rich?





If you are a motivated and qualified communicator, I will personally train you to do 3  20 minutes presentations per day to qualify prospects that I can provide to you.  We will demonstrate to you that you can make $400 a day part time using this system.  Or, if you have 20 hours per week, as in my case, you can make in excess of $10,000 per week, as I am currently generating (verifiable, by the way).  

Plus I will introduce you to my mentor who makes well in excess of $1,000,000 annually.

Many are called, few are chosen.  This opportunity will be limited to one qualified individual per state.  Make the call and call the 24 hour pre-recorded message number below.  We will take as much or as little time as you need to see if this program is right for you.  

                          *** 801-397-9010 *** 

Please do not make this call unless you are genuinely money motivated and qualified.  I need people who already have people skills in place and have either made large amounts of money in the past or are ready to generate large amounts of money in the future.  Looking forward to your call.    

                            *** 801-397-9010 ***

Subject: GDC 2002: Game Scripting in Python
Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2002 15:29:29 -0000
Content-Type: text/plain; encoding=utf-8

URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-4,7132396,159/
Date: 2002-08-22T03:21:04+01:00

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

_Slashdot_: Digital Camera Quality Passing Film?[1] We just hired a 
photographer for our wedding yesterday, Light Touch Imagery[2]. They offer 
competitive prices; they can design the type of albums we want (with some 
amount of artistic touchup); they do bridal and engagement portraits as well as 
full wedding day coverage; they shoot all digital; and they give us all the

Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.

Subject: Could be your last chance for savings

Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

A great sponsor will not make you money.
A great product line will not make you money either.
A great compensation plan will not make you money either.
A great company will not make you money either.

Some say it's a combination of the above.
Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most.

Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc.
Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone.
They wear you out long before you make any money.

What makes you money is a downline associated with a
stable company that has consumable products.

Where's the downline coming from?  Well, we have an
online automatic recruiting system that does the work
for you.  Our system will place paying members in 
your downline.

Furthermore, you can see it working first hand before
you decide what to do, if any.

Plain as Brooklyn Bridge. He'll eat mud like the rest of us. 
Then it will be more becoming than ever. Oh, here 's the pretty violet silk. That will make a lovely suit, cried Polly, going on with the review.

Go and pack your suit-case quickly then! he ordered. I want to get away from here within half an hour!Mrs. Tarns was a woman of nearly sixty, stout and--in appearance--untidy and dirty. The wet wind played with grey wisps of her hair, and with her coarse brown apron, beneath which her skirt was pinned up. Human eye so seldom saw her without a coarse brown apron that, apronless, she would have almost seemed (like Eve) to be unattired. It and a pail were the insignia of her vocation.  My friend Lenoble, said the Captain; and in the next instant a gentleman entered the room, a gentleman who was in every quality the opposite of the person whom Diana had expected to see. .The woman gathered up the remains of the food, crossed herself again before the shrine, and she and her sons prepared to resume the descent of the mountain.  
Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, I understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you'll get your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall. 

Next morning, at nine o'clock, he went to the Rue Neuve-de-Luxembourg to upbraid Louise for her barbarity. But Mme. de Bargeton was not at home to him, and not only so, but the porter would not allow him to go up to her rooms; so he stayed outside in the street, watching the house till noon. At twelve o'clock Chatelet came out, looked at Lucien out of the corner of his eye, and avoided him.  If I have strength to come, I shall return by the next steamer; but the fact is, my dear Gilbert, I am very ill--have been completely prostrate since writing the above--and a doctor here tells me I must not think of the voyage yet awhile. But I shan't allow his opinion to govern me. If I can crawl to the steamer, which starts three days hence, I shall come.

<title> My dear sir, cried the gentleman, making a courteous, deprecatory gesture with his palms spread outward, we owe you a million apologies. There has been a most lamentable mistake!  In this case, a very convenient thing, for she tells me all about her brother's wedding, as no one else would take the trouble to do.?

And your soothing, balmy oils for cancer? Arsenious acid, I suppose, to eat it out?  Have I been too arrogant a lover? too sure of happiness, too blind to my small deserts? Sylvia, have I misunderstood the greeting you have given me?  Then this is why you didn't turn up at the dance? And failed to say these incantatory words of salvation!

Can you locate Master Hardy also?  I stand corrected in grammar as well as fact, he said lightly.  That afternoon, somebody called to fetch the fair copy for Mr. Ashurst. I went out into the front office to see him. To my surprise, it was Higginson--in his guise as courier.  I've brought you in six pairs of pants, said the woman, untying the bundle she had laid upon the counter. 
Do as I have done, my child, said her mother. Be gentle and kind, and your conscience will be at peace. On his death-bed a man may say, 'My wife has never cost me a pang!' And God, who hears that dying breath, credits it to us. If I had abandoned myself to fury like you, what would have happened? Your father would have been embittered, perhaps he would have left me altogether, and he would not have been withheld by any fear of paining me. Our ruin, utter as it now is, would have been complete ten years sooner, and we should have shown the world the spectacle of a husband and wife living quite apart--a scandal of the most horrible, heart-breaking kind, for it is the destruction of the family. Neither your brother nor you could have married. 
No, no. Give it back to me; it must have a case. 


I suppose it was St. Luc?

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently.

Watch out Yahoo Shopping and other shopping meta-sites. Google is at it again

this Christmas shopping season or next year? Google Product Search and 
Ratings....

================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============

Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. 


The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to "look before you leap" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!!


Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.

Everybody gets paid.  No recruiting required.

Join and reserve a position for free now.
Program is 18 weeks old and it's paying.

Everybody gets in line to get paid by all
the new people coming in (but it's NOT a
traditional straightline)...EVERYONE makes money...
and those that sponsor make more....

<!--  by dint of reckless corner-cutting. Captains of great ships behave exactly like two hansom-drivers in the streets of London; they think they can just shave past without grazing; and they DO shave past nine times out of ten. The tenth time they run on the rocks through sheer recklessness, and lose their vessel; and then, the newspapers always ask the same solemn question--in childish good faith--how did so experienced and able a navigator come to make such a mistake in his reckoning? He made NO mistake; he simply tried to cut it fine, and cut it too fine for once, with the result that he usually loses his own life and his passengers. That's all. We who have been at sea understand that perfectly.  -->

<!-- That day and the next the girl's life hung by a thread; then the peril passed, and her recovery became merely a question of careful nursing. The days which immediately followed this certainty were the happiest Lynde had ever experienced. Perhaps it was because his chamber was directly over Ruth's that he sat there in the window-seat, reading from morning until night. It was as near to her as he was permitted to approach. He saw little of Mr. Denham and still less of Mrs. Denham during that week; but the doctor spent an hour or two every evening with Lynde, and did not find it tiresome to talk of nothing but his patient. The details of her convalescence were listened to with an interest that would have won Dr. Pendegrast if he had not already been very well disposed towards the young fellow, several of whose New York friends, as it transpired, were old acquaintances of the doctor's--Dr. Dillon and his family, and the Delaneys. The conversation between Lynde and Dr. Pendegrast at the Hotel Meurice had been hurried and disjointed, and in that respect unsatisfactory; but the minute history of Ruth's previous case, which the doctor related to Lynde in the course of those long summer nights, set his mind completely at rest.  --><!-- If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished.  But he liked it. Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly!  And was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little grand daughter back again.  Beth ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride.  When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was. -->
<!-- I'll kill you sure, you Greaser, as soon as my hands are free!  -->
<!-- In September, when the moon was red and full, and the sea glassy, he announced a series of nocturnal Rocket Fetes. The lifeboat, hung with Chinese lanterns, put out in the evening (charge five shillings) and, followed by half the harbour's fleet of rowing-boats and cutters, proceeded to the neighbourhood of the strip of beach, where a rocket apparatus had been installed by the help of the Lifeboat Secretary. The mortar was trained; there was a flash, a whizz, a line of fire, and a rope fell out of the sky across the lifeboat. The effect was thrilling and roused cheers. Never did the Lifeboat Institution receive such an advertisement as Denry gave it--gratis. -->

<!-- Will did not doubt what Inmutanka said, but his interest in his words was due chiefly to the inferences he drew from them. Inmutanka spoke of the immensity of the bear because they were in the far north, and it was only another confirmation of his belief that the great march after he was taken captive had been made almost due north. They must be in some valley in the vast range of mountains that ran in an unbroken chain from the Arctic to the Antarctic, more than ten thousand miles. Perhaps they had gone much beyond the American line, and this was the last outlying village of the Sioux.  -->

letter[1]. 

    I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of 
    America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current 
    circumstances. 

    I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two 
    children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my 
    husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our 
    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider 
    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic 
    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank 
    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds 
    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my 
    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the 
    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and 
    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.

Security in cyberspace is a different kettle of fish compared to many computer 
systems. Cyberspace entertainment only has to be useful to the majority of its 
users --entertaining. That means it can tolerate a small amount of vandalism 
still remain useful. This is quite unlike a system required for commerce. We 
still have a headache of course, but at least we only need to keep the system 
around 90 percent clean, rather than 99.99 percent. Of course well still 
strive to stamp out corruption, but our system failure threshold is more 
achievable than one might at first assume.

Filled with useful examples and the depth, clarity, and 
attention to detail that made the first edition so popular 
with web developers, the just-released "JavaServer Pages,  
2nd Edition" (Bergsten, $44.95) is completely revised 
and updated to cover the substantial changes in the 
1.2 version of the JSP specifications, and includes 
coverage of the new JSTL Tag libraries--an eagerly 
anticipated standard  set of JSP elements for the tasks  
needed in most JSP  applications, as well as thorough 
coverage of Custom Tag Libraries.  

What people said about the first edition:

"an excellent printed resource on JSPs...I have 
been extremely impressed by its depth, clarity,
 and attention to detail. " 
--Reuven M. Lerner, Linux Journal

"This is a great book: it was written by a key 
contributor not only to the JSP specification, 
but also to the JSP and  Servlet reference 
implementations. Filled with useful examples,
 it stands as an important text in the adoption of 
JSP in the market." 
--Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart, lead JSP Specification Engineer.

<b>CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW</b><br>
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email<br>
Saturday, July 20, 2002<p>
<p>
<b>Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=
r trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=
t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
</b>
<p>
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by <a href=3D"http://clickth=
ru.online.com/Click?q=3D14-5MRAIF-I438XVu98ZvQIzTKtR1dR" >unveiling</a> new=
 iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
<p>
The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=
sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=
 a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=
r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=
odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.
<p>
As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.
<p>
Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =
be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =
improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=

But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
eap upgrade when the company announced it will <a href=3D"http://clickthru.=
online.com/Click?q=3D29-Sg_rIjM3xjSzf59NyGEI9rCM8vcR" >not offer</a> a disc=
ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=
ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=
ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
em for the retail price of $129.
<p>
Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=
hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=
vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=
s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.
<p>
Apple also raised eyebrows by <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
q=3D3e-F51nIizcfoh9HOq_7DQESNPe-iRR" >transitioning</a> its iTools Web serv=
ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=
o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=
s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
 service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=
res.
<p>
Despite iTool's popularity, the company <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.=
com/Click?q=3D53-n86dINniBiqIX-sjHpx8lOheMnlR" >may face a tough sell</a> w=
ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
 free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to=
 form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
.
<p>
To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
 services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=
ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=
 an <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D68-iM8qIsPWu8FuzAvywvj=
sK-FdLP4R" >online petition</a> protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
l for the program.
<p>
<b><font color=3D"#CC0000">Microsoft's moves</font></b><br>
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to <a href=3D"http=
://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D7d-FFEqIDLWMEqg-q9Uywq2NRJSBTeR" >offer a=
 rebate</a> for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=
 bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=
 those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.
<p>
The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
program went on sale last November.
<p>
Microsoft is also putting the <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
q=3D93-V4PmQSdrF0o9nH2cTYjvQ8Rgn5FR" >finishing touches</a> on the third co=
llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
 a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=
ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=
uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
ixes are available as separate downloads.
<p>

Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=
soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has <a href=3D"http://clickt=
hru.online.com/Click?q=3Da8-02XZQQZDjZijEBtDtZs6swzdON9R" >shut down</a> a =
site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=
he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =
inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=
 forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.
<p>
<b><font color=3D"#CC0000">Somebody's watching you</font></b><br>

You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah=
oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=
 to <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dbd-c0nUQ7pV9moRKw2pAEV=
gnfqGsJuR" >swap out</a> a handful of words such as "mocha" and "eval" that=
 pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
<p>
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as "Web enhanced" can contai=
n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS=
cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
 to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
example.
<p>
"Mocha" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =
e-mail. Typing "mocha:" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =
open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
s knowledge.
<p>

On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g=
overnment is again turning to technology to <a href=3D"http://clickthru.onl=
ine.com/Click?q=3Dd2-THo_QULs_DzX3rh3Gl22vbAOyesR" >monitor suspicious acti=
vity</a> in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=
e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=
 to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
suspicious behavior.
<p>
"The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=
y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
 or suspicious activity in public places," according to the TIPS Web site. =
But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=
 fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

 	  An island getaway
An island in Tracadie harbour is about to become the Nova Scotia getaway
for movie stars Ethan Hawke
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1010.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48>
and Uma Thurman
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1347.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48>
and their two children. Owner Marie Kelly confirmed she is finalizing
the sale of her 3.6-hectare island, which comes complete with two
cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination.=20

British boys reserved?
Gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1833.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
currently single and searching for love, has complained that British men
just don't play the dating game the way she's used to. The 29-year-old
actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
Proof, says: "British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake." Gwyneth,
previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1389.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48>
and Ben Affleck
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1411.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she
accepted with pleasure. One of her "very charming" dates was actor James
Purefoy
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/4090.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.

A one-on-one interview
Muscle-bound Vin Diesel
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1206.htm?newsletter=3Dnumber48> ,
star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
he was so taken by Entertainment Tonight reporter, Maria Manounos, that
he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was "available".
It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the
day.

_Kevin Fanning_: Hallmark vs. Successories[1]. &#8220;At Successories you were 
mostly left alone. There'd be brainstorm meetings to come up with new topics to 
tackle ("Howsabout 'Diligence'?" "No I think we did that one already, didn't 
we?") but mostly you could just hang around, bang away at whatever ideas you 
had, show your manager what you were working on, and he/she'd give you 
feedback, encouragement, tell you to keep at it, point to the poster of 
Stick-to-it-iveness on their wall (Yes, we had our own brand of Successories 
posters hanging everywhere. I mean why not.) and give you the thumbs up.&#8221;

When I tried to deploy a staging/production Drupal installation on GoDaddy, the redirect URLs are not being set correctly causing the system to act dead. Example 1: (1) go to login screen: <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/"></a> [1] (2) enter name and password (3) press "login" button (4) address bar shows " <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/customerror/403?destination=node%2F1"></a>  " with status bar "Done" and a blank page. If I edit the address bar to my home page ( <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/"></a>  [2]) I go there and have been logged in properly. Example 2: (1) go to a node: <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/node/123"></a> [3] (2) click "Edit" (3) form entry screen is displayed properly <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/node/123/edit"></a>  [4] (4) change field (5) click "Save" button (4) address bar shows " <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/node/123/edit"></a>  " with status bar "Done" and a blank page. If I modify the address to the node again ( <a href="http://www.gluestick.com/pims/node/123"></a>  [5]) I go there properly and the changes have been saved. So the actions are happening appropriately, but the subsequent URL (where to go next) is not being sent back to the browser correctly. Navigating through links and buttons that specifically identify a URL work properly -- only problems at the end of a button action that sets a new URL. There is a lot of discussion about getting Clean URLs to work on GoDaddy, but I don't think that is the problem. The redirect URL is either not getting set at the end of an action, or the new page is not getting sent to the browser. Questions: - How is the URL set to go *AFTER* the buttons are pressed? - Why is this working on localhost and not on GoDaddy? - Is there some trick about Linux Shared Host configuration on GoDaddy that someone knows about? Thanks.

Hi All, I personally think point three of Karen's email is a good idea, as Evergreen does use a fair bit of Mozilla's XULrunner as its backbone. But I would also like to add, we could as a community put on Evergreen 's OPAC a logo which combine both, the Evergreen logo and the Mozilla logo, which we could put at the bottom of the OPAC screen where the current logo is. I have included a copy of my idea in JPEG (.jpg) format attached to this email for comment, or ideas.

For the conference videos (being processed right this very moment, actually), several video sites ask about licensing. Is Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike all right? 2. Also, are you all ok with the Internet Archive for the conference videos? It's free, files can be almost 2 gigs (which is about 50 minutes of an mpeg2 file, or about your average talk), and their goals seem at least congruent with Evergreen 's. 3. As you may have read earlier, the Mozilla Foundation has listed Evergreen as a featured software on its site. The foundation has also asked if Evergreen would be interested in including the 'Powered by Mozilla' logo on its site.

Top level dir: ./configure && make Fell at the first fence - I can't find a configure file in \qtsharp, \qtsharp\src, \qtsharp\src\binge etc... Cheers, Martin -----Original Message----- From: Adam Treat [mailto: many ... <a href="http://yahoo.com"></a> ] Sent: 29 June 2004 23:01 To: KDE bindings for other programming languages; qtcs ... @lists.sourceforge.nett Subject: [Kde-bindings] Primer on building/using Binge and the generated newQt# bindings On Tuesday 29 June 2004 5:31 pm, Martin Welch wrote: I've started to look through the code -- GlueStick .cs fascinated me for some reason -- but I'll await your howto before I go any further. Thanks again. Martin Here is the quick overview of howto compile, generate and test Binge code: Assuming you have latest release Mono, Pnet, Qt etc, etc You'll have to manually edit a few files after they've been generated and move around the resultant .so and .dll files.. Top level dir: ./configure && make This will proceed for awhile, first building Binge and then using Binge to generate the newlibqtsharp C++ glue library and then proceed to compile that... It'll error on src/newlibqtsharp/QFontDialogGlue.cpp. This is because the api.xml file I'm using is months old and the new Qt version makes some of this files methods private. 1) Edit QFontDialogGlue.cpp and remove the offending methods: eventFilter, updateFamilies, updateStyles, updateScripts, and updateSizes. 2. Finish compiling newlibqtsharp and then the build will move on to generating the bindings in newbindings... 3. You'll see an error in QMessageBox regarding the property 'TheIcon'. Remove the 'override' keyword from this generated file and then issue a 'csant' command in newbindings. This is because of some nasty swings in the inheritance tree for this particular prop... 3. If you forget and issue a 'make' command instead of 'csant' it'll throw a bunch of errors because of this bug in mcs: <a href="http://bugs.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60603"></a>  That's why you use pnet's cscc via the generic 'csant' command :) 4. Ok, now you are almost done and ready to go. Copy the libnewqtsharp.so* files in newlibqtsharp into "newexamples/samples/" and do likewise for the NewQt.dll in newbindings. Go into newexamples/samples and issue another 'csant'. 5. You can invoke the examples with 'mono hello.exe' or 'ilrun emit.exe' to see how they work. That's it for now. I have some modifications in my local tree that aren't quite ready for primetime, but they enable full virtual/override inheritance goodness. Oh, and you can see the list for a few modifications we are still going to make for the signal/slot stuff. It is quite complete now, but we're thinking of some magic so we can omit the emit call ;) KDE bindings are on the way as soon as we can get caught up.

Subject: Government plans to hand out free Valium
Date: Fri, 04 Oct 2002 08:00:23 -0000
Content-Type: text/plain; encoding=utf-8

URL: http://boingboing.net/#85521686

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium. 
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a 
free dose. Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of 
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for 
that. 

    The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm 
    people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations 
    where lethal weapons are inappropriate.

<!-- These disappointments had told upon Mme. de Marville, who, moreover, had formed a tolerably correct estimate of her husband. A temper naturally shrewish was soured till she grew positively terrible. She was not old, but she had aged; she deliberately set herself to extort by fear all that the world was inclined to refuse her, and was harsh and rasping as a file. Caustic to excess she had few friends among women; she surrounded herself with prim, elderly matrons of her own stamp, who lent each other mutual support, and people stood in awe of her. As for poor Pons, his relations with this fiend in petticoats were very much those of a schoolboy with the master whose one idea of communication is the ferule.  -->

It seems like ATTWS will offer a service that'll tell you where your friends 
(or children or spouse or whatever) are ... I haven't seen it announced, but 
from their "Explanation of Rates and Charges. "Find Friends service will only 
locate a compatible mobile device with mMode service that (1) has granted you 
permission, (2) is turned on, (3) is registered on the AT&T Wireless GSM/GPRS 
network, and (4) has not activated Be Invisible. Location services only provide 
the location...

       Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''.
       Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.
        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.
        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.
        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.
        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.
        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.
        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. 
        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.
         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. 
         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.
         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.
          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.
          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

Johnny U: Johnny Unitas was the National Football League's most valuable
player twice - and he led Baltimore to victory in "Super Bowl Five."
For those of you younger than 30: this WAS modern football.  The game
was played on artificial turf. (Richard Burkard/
http://www.Laughline.com)

Announcement: How telling is it that the death of Johnny Unitas was
announced by the Baltimore Ravens - and not the Colts, who now play in
Indianapolis?  When the Colt owners moved out of Baltimore years ago,
they apparently left all the history books behind. (Burkard)

Dick Disappears: Vice President Dick Cheney remains at an undisclosed
location.  The move is for security reasons.  The Bush Administration
is trying to keep him at a safe distance from would-be subpoenas. (Alan
Ray - http://www.araycomedy.com)

Noelle Nabbed: Jeb Bush's daughter Noelle is in trouble with the law
again.  When she was a child, her dad would read her favorite bedtime
story.  Goldilocks and the Three Strikes. (Ray)

AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks

If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, "the No.
1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
[New York's] Upper East Side.

"It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store"
on Madison Avenue, which features "rich vulnerable women," the mag's
October issue says.

AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
place published, or being cited as the "in" place for finding loaded women
- or rather, women who are loaded.

"The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!" an AA
spokesman told The Post.

O.K.

Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls

A man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the
disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made
three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the
youngsters.
He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers
traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.
The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one
count of wasting police time on August 15 this year.
The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls
having been drinking all day.
Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor
calculated but added that this was no excuse.
He said: "What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's
caused the families is unacceptable."
Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will
be sentenced.
The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the
defendant has been warned custody is an option.

ein 
anstandiger Deutscher und kein wahrer Nationalsozialist. Der beste Gradmesser fur den Wert einer 
Gesinnung, die Aufrichtigkeit seiner Uberzeugung und die Kraft seines Wollens ist die Feindschaft, die 
ihm von seiten des Todfeindes unseres Volkes entgegengebracht wird. 

Die Anhanger der Bewegung und in weiterem Sinne das ganze Volk mussen immer und immer wieder 
darauf hingewiesen werden, da. der Jude in seinen Zeitungen stets lugt, und da. selbst eine einmalige 
Wahrheit nur zur Deckung einer gro.eren Falschung bestimmt und damit selber wieder gewollte 
Unwahrheit ist. Der Jude ist der gro.e Meister im Lugen, und Lug und Trug sind seine Waffen im 
Kampfe. 

Jede judische Verleumdung und jede judische Luge ist eine Ehrennarbe am Korper unserer Kampfer.

ische Zweikammersystem seine Wiederauferstehung. 
Nur die "Hauser" selber waren etwas verschieden. Als Barry einst seinen Parlamentspalast aus den 
Fluten der Themse her herauswachsen lie., da griff er in die Geschichte des britischen Weltreichs hinein 
und holte sich aus ihr den Schmuck fur die 1200 Nischen, Konsolen und Saulen seines Prachtbaues 
heraus. In Bildwerk und Malerkunst wurde so das Haus der Lords und des Volkes zum Ruhmestempel 
der Nation. 

Hier kam die erste Schwierigkeit fur Wien. Denn als der Dane Hansen die letzten Giebel am 
Marmorhaus der neuen Volksvertretung vollendet hatte, da blieb ihm auch zur Zierde nichts anderes 
ubrig, als Entlehnungen bei der Antike zu versuchen. Romische und griechische Staatsmanner und 
Philosophen verschonern und dieses Theatergebaude der "westlichen Demokratie", und in symbolischer 
Ironie ziehen uber den zwei Hausern die Quadrigen nach den vier Himmelsrichtungen auseinander, auf 
solche Art dem damaligen Treiben im Innern auch nach au.en den besten Ausdruck verleihend. 

Die "Nationalitaten" hatten es sich als Beleidigung und Provokation verbeten, da. in diesem Werke 
osterreichische Geschichte verherrlicht wurde, so wie man im Reiche selbst ja auch erst unter dem 
Donner der Weltkriegsschlachten wagte, den Wallotschen Bau des Reichstages durch Inschrift dem 
deutschen Volke zu weihen. 

Als ich, noch nicht zwanzig Jahre alt, zum ersten Male in den Prachtbau am Franzensring ging, um als 
Zuschauer und Horer einer Sitzung des Abgeordnetenhauses beizuwohnen, ward ich von den 
widerstrebendsten Gefuhle erfa.t. 

Ich hatte schon von jener das Parlament geha.t, jedoch durchaus nicht als Institution an sich. Im 
Gegenteil, als freiheitlich empfindender Mensch konnte ich mir eine andere 

{082 Der Parlamentarismus} 

Moglichkeit der Regierung gar nicht vorstellen, denn der Gedanke irgendeiner Diktatur ware mir bei 
meiner Haltung zum Hause Habsburg als Verbrechen wider die Freiheit und gegen jede Vernunft 
vorgekommen. 

Nicht wenig trug dazu bei, da. mir als jungem Menschen infolge meines vielen Zeitunglesens, ohne da.

Some classics from this period, now in a new English translation:
"The Sagas of Icelanders" in trade paperback, from (duh) Viking, in 2000.
Remaindered at my local Barnes & Ignoble.   The historical reference 
material is useful.

Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.

<!-- Bertram gazed at her, distressed. Her tone was distressing. Horror and indignation for a moment overcame him. She had had to slip in there like a fugitive or a criminal. She had had to crawl away by stealth from that man, her keeper. She, a grown woman and a moral agent, with a will of her own and a heart and a conscience, was held so absolutely in serfdom as a particular man's thrall and chattel, that she could not even go out to visit a friend without these degrading subterfuges of creeping in unperceived by a back entrance, and talking low under her breath, lest a lodging-house crone should find out what she was doing. And all the world of England was so banded in league with the slave-driver against the soul he enslaved, that if Miss Blake had seen her she could hardly have come in: while, once in, she must tremble and whisper and steal about with muffled feet, for fear of discovery in this innocent adventure. He held his breath with stifled wrath. It was painful and degrading.  -->

>>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk

 Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK 

 Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims. 

 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 "I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated," said the NCIS
 spokesman. "It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online." 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 

 Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 "To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology," said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Putting on the brakes[1]. &#8220;So, the answer to the 
question that started this whole project, "what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good 
for?" is two things: it's good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it's good for 
writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; 
- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. 
&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? 
Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or 
may not be the answer to these problems!&#8221; Complete with an example of 
parsing FOAF files. 
- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce 
RDF schemas[3]. &#8220;XML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are 
evidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of 
tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make 
heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in 
RDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have 
been writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.&#8221; Also includes a cogent 
explanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML.

                    (aka Growth Factor, hGH, HGH, Growth Hormone, GH, H=
uman Growth 
                    Hormone) is naturally produced by the anterior pitu=
itary gland 
                    in the brain and declines with age, so it is a natu=
ral substance 
                    already in your body right this moment. HGH is know=
n as the 
                    master hormone because it exerts effects over all o=
ther hormones 
                    in the body, including Testosterone, Estrogen, Prog=
esterone 
                    and DHEA. Augmenting declining somatotropin levels =
by giving 
                    your body daily ingestible somatotropin, can create=
 a more 
                    youthful hormone balance that results in dramatic i=
mprovements 
                    in your health.<br>
                    &nbsp; Somatotropin supplementation 
                    is a life-enhancement. Lives that were once shatter=
ed by fatigue, 
                    illness or the ravages of aging, now fourish with t=
he help 
                    of somatotropin supplementation.<br>
                    &nbsp; Somatotropin from the pituitary 
                    works by stimulating protein production in all tiss=
ues of 
                    the body. This results in an increase in organ heal=
ing and 
                    regeneration, which is associated with increase res=
istance

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online "anarchist scavenger
hunt" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
"so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action."

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

"People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff," he said. "I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points."

Feorag writes from Scotland: "You probably haven't heard of John Otway, but he 
has a small and devoted following here. He did a limited issue CD and asked his 
fans to vote on which track _they'd_ like to see as a single. The one they 
picked just entered the UK charts at number 9! Bet that'll piss off the major 
record labels, especially as the marketing budget was probably about zero. I 
might just watch Top of the Pops this week." Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks,

I discovered jmason.org in Yahoo, my favorite directory. I am requesting that you create a link from jmason.org to my client's web site if you feel that their content is in some way related or complements your site. In exchange, I'll post a link from their site to yours.  

Exchanging links will help bring in more business for both your web site and my client's. An added benefit is increased search engine traffic because the search engines rank sites higher that have a good number of relevant links.

This is not a free-for-all link exchange, I don't waste my time with them and you shouldn't either. I am only linking to related web sites so that all my links are relevant to my site.

I would like to send you my client's web address, so that you can review their site. My client offers web site promotion and and optimization services for search engines. 


Please let me know if you are interested in exchanging links. I'll send you more details once I hear back from you.

Looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Donna Martos

P.S. If for any reason you don't want me to contact again, just email me and let me know.

Dr. Elliot turned on Hal with an imperative question. 
The doctor's thin figure seemed fairly to shrink at the idea. 

Holsworthy rose too. Mayn't I go with you? he asked, eagerly. The French General guessed rightly that here in the desert, on this bare rock in the sea, the nun had seized upon music as an outpouring of the passion that still consumed her. Was this her manner of offering up her love as a sacrifice to God? Or was it Love exultant in triumph over God? The questions were hard to answer. But one thing at least the General could not mistake--in this heart, dead to the world, the fire of passion burned as fiercely as in his own.   It is Mr. Pennypacker, said the schoolmaster joyfully, and I'm no more of a ghost than you are. I've come back from captivity, bringing with me two of those who saved me, young citizens of this village, Henry Ware and Paul Cotter. .<br />It's impertinence and mummery, repeated de Peyster, I'll have that man Doran tied to a cannon and lashed on his bare back!  
Hi there! he cried. Who are you? 

Not that Hal knew this, nor, had he known it, would have cared. Sick at heart, he waited about the hospital reception room for such meager hopes as the surgeons could give him, until an urgent summons compelled him to go to the office. Wayne had telephoned for him half a dozen times, finally leaving a message that he must see him on a point in the tenement-ownership story, to be run on the morrow.  The only thing that I want to find out is whether you care 
</style>

<title> You show me what I should be. All my life I have desired strength of heart and stability of soul; may I not hope to earn for myself a little of the integrity I love in you? If courage, self-denial, and self-help, make you what you are, can I have a more effectual guide? You say you shall outlive this passion; why should not I imitate your brave example, and find the consolations you shall find? Oh, Adam, let me try.  Don't laugh at her, or discourage her; let her find comfort in bibs and dust-pans, if she can, whispered Polly to Fan, while Maud took a joyful header among the pillows, and came up smiling and blowzy, for she loved house-work, and often got lectured for stolen visits to the kitchen, and surreptitious sweepings and dustings when the coast was clear.

Oh, I got a head and I've been doing some heavy thinking with it, the Kid retorted. This here Dawson is going to be a good town. I'm getting readied up to join the parade.  Shall I disturb you if I say, 'Good-night'? Look here, mister. I go straight to the point. What'll you take? You'll find that money yet--somewhere, when you're
That's true as far as it goes, but it's not all.  We've heard--and the news is correct beyond a doubt--that Grant has taken Vicksburg and Pemberton's army with it. 
'Mr. Wendover is a young man, but he has evidently abused his constitution; there is no knowing what may happen if you don't take care of him. Alcohol is a cumulative poison, and that pegging I have told you of is diabolical. Nature throws off an over-dose of alcohol, but the daily, hourly dose eats into the system.' 


I've got a friend among 'em. Woodville is his name, and he's about my own age.

The plan is to produce four print magazines per year. Cost: $12/year
(US); $20/year (international). Let's all make this happen by signing
up!" The web site says that they'll attempt to go print if they get
enough subscription pledges.

Subject: [dgc.chat] First public release of NeuDist Distributed Transaction
Clearing	Framework

Reply-To: <dgcchat@lists.goldmoney.com>

I'm happy to announce the first public release of NeuDist

NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications
for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers.

Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in Java/XML development.

There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available
in the next release.

The framework currently contains the following:
- Classes for creating "Named Objects", which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy.
- Storage framework for "Named Objects".
- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations)
- Simple SOAP client
- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on "Named
  Objects".
- Current types of "Named Objects" include:
    NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication
 	Framework
    AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using
	digital signatures.


Next major release is scheduled to contain:
 - Core:
	hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level 	NameSpaces
 - Signing Services:
	Implementation of web based signing services
	End user hosted signing service
 - Example User Authentication Application
 - Example Payment System based on NeuDist

I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things.

Read more about NeuDist or download our early version at
http://neudist.org
I would love to hear your questions and suggestions. To discuss it
further please join neudist-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net

Pelle

Listen to Lockergnomie Dale Lowery and you'll save time
immediately. It's an old tip, but it bears repeating: "I'll often
find Web snippets I'd like to keep - but I don't want to save the
entire page. So, I've HOT-KEYED Notepad. Easy! Get to the most
common Notepad shortcut icon: Start | Programs | Accessories |
Notepad. Then right-click on the menu item and select Properties.
You'll see that this is (indeed) a shortcut; in the lower part of
the dialog is a field to add a hotkey. I entered 'N' for Notepad,
Windows offered CTRL and ALT as a prefix, and now I can launch
Notepad in an instant. I highlight the text I want to keep, copy
it, tap my shortcut, paste it, and then save the new text file
wherever I want. Most often, I use this trick to copy paragraphs
that describe downloads (and save them as text files in the same
folder as the download)." Just make sure you don't pick a keyboard
shortcut that's already in use. Otherwise, one of them is gonna
get cranky.

<p>

And while we're taking a trip down memory lane, Lockergnomie Ian
Rich reminds us of Jouni Vuorio's utility: The site is
<a href="http://www.jv16.org/">jv16.org</a>. The program is called
jv16 Power Tools, and this freeware is truly worthy of praise. It
combines a full-on registry management tool with several file
manager tools: one to hunt down temporary files in any format and
the other to help perform advanced file searches and comparisons.
Mainly, I wanted the program to be brought to the attention of the
consumer public, as it moves further and further along in
development it just keeps getting better. I've used it on windows
Me, and now XP - without crashes or hair-raising Registry
corruption. It backs up everything it changes and is very easy to
use. If you're interested in something of shareware-quality with
forum support (for absolutely nothing), get this program. Anyway,
I love the newsletter and the work you guys and gals do at
Lockergnome. I hope that this author gets his recognition."
Consider this a huge nod!

<p>

I love a good resource, and Lockergnomie Elton Jonsson from the
United Kingdom has one for us, too: "As a dedicated subscriber, I
just had to tell about this one. Have you ever been driven mad
trying to find out the name of the piece of music on a television
advert? Well, at last, here in the UK, we have an answer to that
problem and, given that many multinationals use the same
advertising in the USA as they do here, it may help out you guys
as well. Check out <a href="http://www.commercialbreaksandbeats.co.uk/">Commercial
Breaks and Beats</a>. I have no connection with it; I'm just
grateful that someone has had the brilliant idea of creating it.
If you check the message board on the site, you'll see that I'm
not alone." This <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Television/Commercials/">Google
Directory</a> can help fill in the blanks, I'm sure. I
almost fell out of my chair the other day when I heard "Yeh Yeh"
(by TMBG) being played on a Chrysler advertisement. Way to go:
John, John, Dan, Dan, and Dan! You're the dogs kids love to bite.

<p>

And what's say we round out the report with another tip?
Lockergnomie David Brown can oblige: "The e-mail forwarding
service is a good idea, but you can do it yourself with Outlook
Express. Set up two accounts (one for your old account and one for
your new one). Craft your reply in a new message and save it.
Then, select Tools | Message Rules | Mail | New rule. Check 'Where
the message is from specified account' in the first section.
'Reply with message" in section two. Select the appropriate
account and message in the final section. Name it. You can also
have the messages flagged or moved to another folder if you want
to know which messages came from the old account. Once the rule
has been created, any mail from the old account will have a reply
sent. People should learn about mail rules, anyway." True! So,
what rule simplifies your day?

{Calendar utility} You say you want to get together on the 25th, but what DAY is that? I'm not good with calendar dates; truth be told, I don't even know what day of the week it is most the time. If I didn't have my PDA armed with a Calendar with me, then I wouldn't show up to anything on time, let alone on the right day. Well, that is great for when I am mobile, but what about when I am in front of my PC? The PDA is docked, but that doesn't mean I have to be without a calendar... enter QuicKalendar! "QuicKalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments." You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. My suggestion is to play with the size of QuicKalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. Now, you'll have no reason to be late for Gnomedex!

{Tetris-like game} I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. To me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. "For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games." I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!

<b>How to Troubleshoot Issues with Reading CDs</b>

{Disc device troubleshooting} "This article describes how you can troubleshoot issues reading CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical discs. This article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with CD-R and CD-RW devices. The steps in this article apply to compact disc (CD-ROM) drives, compact disc recordable (CD-R) drives, compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives, and digital video disc (DVD) drives." To summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. Some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. Make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. The steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. If this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem ISN'T!

<b>Modem Spy v3.1.3b [230k] W9x/2k/XP $25</b><br>
    Unearthed by Sergei Polishchuk
<p>
<a class="url" href="http://www.modemspy.com/">http://www.modemspy.com/</a>
<p>
{Answering machine} "Modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. Features: 1) Records phone conversations. 2) Records from microphone. 3) Plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) Plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) Can record ALL incoming phone calls. 6) Has built-in software automatic gain control. 7) Detects and logs Caller ID." Gnomie Brian Stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! Brian says, "I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.

<b>The Avocado Papers</b><br>
   Unearthed by Meryl Evans
<p>
<a class="url" href="http://www.theavocadopapers.com/">http://www.theavocadopapers.com/</a>
<p>
After surfing serious Web site upon serious Web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. TheAvocadoPapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. It isn't that the Web site is really about anything; there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week "Steve Schneider Interviews Himself"). If you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read Ron Bork's diary or enter the Avocado Chat. Although the makers of the Web site don't even know what it is about, I think it is quite apparent... fun! Go check out the Web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. Worst-case scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine!

<p><br><table bgcolor="#FFCC99" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td><p class="title">&nbsp;GnomeTIP</p></td></tr></table><p>

This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. "The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions." To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any "idle tasks." Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. "All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks." Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.

The number of web sites offering news & information using feeds is
exploding! A feed is a regularly updated summary of web content, along wi=
th
links to full versions of that content.=20
When you subscribe to a given website's feed by using a feed reader, you'=
ll
receive a summary of new content from that website right on your screen o=
r
in a software feed reader.=20
Many websites are using feeds to publish their latest information right t=
o
thousands of users within minutes. Soon everyone will be using them. This
makes feeds the ideal place to advertise.

More and more people are subscribing to feeds every day and there are
millions who are already subscribed.
Thus, your ad will reach a very broad range of potential customers with
each use of Feed Blaster!

Feed Blaster is the first & only submitter that can submit your ads to
thousands of feeds within a few minutes!=A0


Post your ads where people read them!

- What if you could place your ad into all these feeds ?

Right, that would mean you would have millions of sites
linking to your ad - and millions of users reading your message within
minutes - and my idea actually works.

I hope at some point that as this topic settles itself out that one of the things that comes from it is that we all were able to hear from a number of leaders and we listened to each other.

Something to keep in mind, is that no one involves themselves in User Group leadership without giving of their time and energy, and invariably hearing more loud complaints than a hail of Thank Yous. I have been actively training myself to ignore the loudness of the negative, yet pick up details for improvement - very very hard for me, and be more grateful for the more subtle acts of gracious gratitude.

I am really grateful for all the statements but particularly my colleague Michael Horton's of LAFCPUG, and the previous message that yes the FCPUG's are in a league of our own. I also agree with Michael that it is not because we are some huge corporation, but rather because of the dedication of many savvy, honest, and dedicated leaders and an amazing group of people worldwide who are happy to participate. Our members generally really like what they are doing - either as a profession, or a rather expensive hobby - and seek to learn how to do it better.

some things you will find that are typical for the FCPUG Network groups:

we talk to each other

we find incredibly inexpensive ways to do everything - bottom line, if you don't spend, you don't need $$

we genuinely like each other, we love to get together, most editors work alone, UG meetings awaken the social

we don't complain about what Apple does or doesn't do, we just like their products and are pretty shameless

we are open to different ways of doing things, new technologies, and are always looking for the FCP compatibility

some groups have democratically elected leaders, most don't : it really depends on what each group wants to do.

we look for what works, share what we can, and make positive referrals within our groups and between them

When Kevin Monahan established SF Cutters over ten years ago, his motto then and still is "Share the Love" maybe that is San Francisco, but it still works for me.

My hope is that people do this because it makes them happy to do it, and not one more burden on their backs.
Apple products have always been cool, are still setting trends, and for me and my colleagues I think it is enough just to keep up with the news of how it works, the possibilities of how to do it better, and how to help everyone tell their stories in whatever context that may be, and in the process broaden all of our horizons.

Have a great day, and thank you for the opportunity to learn more about you, and connect names with the groups you lead.

Best wishes,

Claudia Crask

A guy struck up a conversation with a young lady in a bar.  After a half
dozen drinks, he suggested they get their own bottle and retire to his
motel room, and she readily agreed. "Say, how old are you, anyway?" the
guy asked.
    "Thirteen," she replied with a shy smile. 
    "Thirteen?   Thirteen!?  My God, Girl!  Get your clothes back on at
once and get the hell out of here!  Are you crazy?" he thundered.
    Pausing at the door as she left, the girl smiled.  "Superstitious,
huh?"

IN THIS ISSUE:

01. Secure IE
02. Disk cleanup on XP
03. Thanks but no thanks
04. Mouseless way home
05. Kartoo
06. XP time feature
07. Leaf Peeper Alert
08. Saving scraps
09. Quick access
10. Don't believe your email

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has 
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks 
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize 
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up 
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky 
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server 
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe 
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of 
software, check out what our Panel had to say at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, 
visit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, 
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super 
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day 
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on "Recommend NNT."  Nothing could 
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find 
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
whenever needed.

10.  DON'T BELIEVE YOUR EMAIL.  We've been asked about those emails with 
virus attachments that appear to be coming from NNT, asking for a 
confirmation of a subscription.  Don't believe it, and don't open the 
attachments.  Maybe this exchange between NNT and Lyris (our mail manager) 
will clear things up:

NNT: Is there anything that can be done about the current strains of virus 
that implant on address books and randomly send email asking alleged 
subscribers to verify their subscription (when they haven't subscribed at 
all)? I've received some of these as well, and I know it's become a 
widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will 
all around.  Is there some configuration that we could change to keep 
these from going out except to legitimate subscribers?

Lyris:  Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it 
isn't actually ListManager doing the sending.  The real problem is that 
people sometimes will add the "join" address to their address book and 
that is what causes the problems.  The best we can do is advise people not 
to have their address books set to automatically add any email address 
that they send a message to even once.  The main culprit here seems to be 
Outlook Express.

WHAT'S COMING NEXT WEEK:  Another batch of Neat Net Tricks in the Premium 
issue, including:

*  A great collection of information and free downloads to make your system 
more secure.

*  Free software to measure and display your real-time Internet speed.

*  Can you handle still another popup stopper - that's interference free - 
and at no cost?

*  An easy-to-use tool to store and arrange all your passwords, user IDs, 
and other info.

*  A Microsoft Word tip to easily work around that pesky autocompletion 
feature.

*  A whole arsenal of tools to combat spam.

*  Software that provides more than 200 interesting facts about your 
computer and displays about your CPU, memory, operating system, and your 
computer's power source.

*  Our in-depth article discusses how to best manage our important 
passwords and get out of trouble when we -inevitably - forget those passwords.

And more!  If you haven't subscribed yet, you won't find a better source of 
useful information for just 42 cents per issue.  That's $10 for a year's 
worth - 24 issues - at the NNT Store, http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store .

Pro-hunt activists target top sight

ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA)  a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance  admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn  which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a
lorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job."
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."
An RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good."
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

<!-- Gilbert left the court after having asked a few questions about Jacob Nowell's funeral. The old man had been buried at Kensalgreen, followed to the grave only by the devoted Tulliver, Mr. Medler, and the local surgeon who had attended him in his last illness. He had lived a lonely friendless life, holding himself aloof from his fellow-creatures; and there were neither neighbours nor friends to lament his ending. The vagabond boys of the neighbourhood had clustered round the door to witness the last dismal ceremony of Mr. Nowell's existence, and had hung about the shop-front for some time after the funeral _cortege_ had departed, peering curiously down into the darksome area, and speculating upon the hoards of wealth which the old miser had hidden away in coal-cellars and dust-bins, under the stone flags of the scullery, or in the crannies of the dilapidated walls. There were no bounds to the imagination of these street Arabs, who had been in the habit of yelping and whooping at the old man's heels when he took his infrequent walks abroad, assailing him with derisive epithets alluding to his miserly propensities. Amongst the elders of the court there was some little talk about the dead man, and the probable disposal of his property, with a good deal of argument and laying down of the law on the part of the graver and wiser members of that community; some people affecting to know to a sixpence the amount of Jacob Nowell's savings, others accrediting him with the possession of fabulous riches, and all being unanimous in the idea that the old man's heir or heirs, as the case might be, would speedily scatter his long-hoarded treasures. Many of these people could remember the silversmith's prodigal son; but none among them were aware of that gentleman's return. They wondered a good deal as to whether he was still living, and whether the money had been left to him or to that pretty young woman who had appeared in the last days of the old man's life, no one knowing whence she had come. There was nothing to be gained from questioning Luke Tulliver, the court knew of old experience. The most mysterious dungeons of the Spanish Inquisition, the secret chambers under the leads in Venice, were not closer or deeper than the mind of that young man. The court had been inclined to think that Luke Tulliver would come into all his master's money; and opinion inclined that way even yet, seeing that Mr. Tulliver still held his ground in the shop, and that no strangers had been seen to enter the place since the funeral.  -->

I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers <a 
href="mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer 
Skills">volunteering</a> a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 




Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for <a 
href="mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Organization 
Suggestion">organizations</a> that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for <a 
href="mailto:tony@Lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer name 
suggestion">names</a> for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.<p>

It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to <a href="http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/26269.html" 
target="_blank">this</a> article on <a href="http://theregister.co.uk/" 
target="_blank">The Register</a>, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.<p>

I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 




were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 




years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 




free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income <a 
href="http://www.gnometomes.com/" target="_blank">sources</a>.<p>

On a brighter note, it looks like <a href="http://www.mandrake.com/" 
target="_blank">Mandrake</a> has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the <a
href="http://mandrakelinux.com/en/club/"target="_blank">Mandrake Linux User's
Club</a>.<p>

The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with <a href="http://www.microtel.com/"
target="_blank">Microtel</a> to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on <a
href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=102252&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A102252" target="_blank">WalMart.com</a>.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both <a href="http://www/lindows.com/" target="_blank">Lindows</a> 
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.<p>

Have a great Wednesday.<p><p>

<b>Checking Mail With KMail</b><p>

I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 

my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.<p>

There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.<p>

To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 

your KDE panel. Select "Preferences" and the "Execute" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kmail --check -caption "%c" %i %m<p>

The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.<p>

Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?<p> <p>

<b>Kernel Configuration - Part XIII</b><p>

As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 

come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.<p>

I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 

Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.<p>

For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:<p>

<a class="url" 
href="http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Security-Quickstart-HOWTO/index.html">The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues<p>

<a class="url" href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/211/1/" 
target="_blank">Linux Network Security from Linux Planet</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a nice tutorial on network security<p>

target="_blank">Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other approaches to network security<p>


These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
Linux kernel.<p><p>

<b>Linux PR</b><p>

<a class="url" href="http://linuxpr.com/">http://linuxpr.com/</a><p>

If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
your favorite OS.<p><p>

 1 The LORD abhors dishonest scales,                                                                   
        but accurate weights are his delight.                                                                   
                                                                    
  2 When pride comes, then comes disgrace,                                                                   
        but with humility comes wisdom.                                                                   
                                                                    
  3 The integrity of the upright guides them,                                                                   
        but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity.                                                                   
                                                                    
  4 Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath,                                                                   
        but righteousness delivers from death.                                                                   
                                                                    
  5 The righteousness of the blameless makes a straight way for them,                                                                   
        but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness.                                                                   
                                                                    
  6 The righteousness of the upright delivers them,                                                                   
        but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires.                                                                   
                                                                    
  7 When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes;                                                                   
        all he expected from his power comes to nothing.                                                                   
                                                                    
  8 The righteous man is rescued from trouble,                                                                   
        and it comes on the wicked instead.                                                                   
                                                                    
  9 With his mouth the godless destroys his neighbor,                                                                   
        but through knowledge the righteous escape.                                                                   
                                                                    
  10 When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices;                                                                   
        when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.                                                                   
                                                                    
  11 Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,                                                                   
        but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed.                                                                   
                                                                    
  12 A man who lacks judgment derides his neighbor,                                                                   
        but a man of understanding holds his tongue.                                                                   
 13 A gossip betrays a confidence,                                                                   
        but a trustworthy man keeps a secret.                                                                   
                                                                    
  14 For lack of guidance a nation falls,                                                                   
        but many advisers make victory sure.                                                                   
                                                                    
  15 He who puts up security for another will surely suffer,                                                                   
        but whoever refuses to strike hands in pledge is safe.                                                                   
                                                                    
  16 A kindhearted woman gains respect,                                                                   
        but ruthless men gain only wealth.                                                                   
                                                                    
  17 A kind man benefits himself,                                                                   
        but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.                                                                   
                                                                    
  18 The wicked man earns deceptive wages,                                                                   
        but he who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.                                                                   
                                                                    
  19 The truly righteous man attains life,                                                                   
        but he who pursues evil goes to his death.                                                                   
                                                                    
  20 The LORD detests men of perverse heart                                                                   
        but he delights in those whose ways are blameless.                                                                   
                                                                    
  21 Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished,                                                                   
        but those who are righteous will go free.                                                                   
                                                                    
  22 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout                                                                   
        is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.                                                                   
                                                                    
  23 The desire of the righteous ends only in good,                                                                   
        but the hope of the wicked only in wrath.                                                                   
                                                                    
  24 One man gives freely, yet gains even more;                                                                   
        another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty.                                                                   
                                                                    
  25 A generous man will prosper;                                                                   
        he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.                                                                   
                                                                    
  26 People curse the man who hoards grain,                                                                   
        but blessing crowns him who is willing to sell.                                                                   
                                                                    
  27 He who seeks good finds goodwill,                                                                   
        but evil comes to him who searches for it.                                                                   
                                                                    
  28 Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,                                                                   
        but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf.                                                                   
                                                                    
  29 He who brings trouble on his family will inherit only wind,                                                                   
        and the fool will be servant to the wise.                                                                   
                                                                    
  30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,                                                                   
        and he who wins souls is wise.                                                                   
                                                                    
  31 If the righteous receive their due on earth,                                                                   
        how much more the ungodly and the sinner!                                                                   
                                                                    
     It is safe to say that when God created the world and all the majestic things in it, when he streaked the heavens with radiant color and the earth with grand mountains and awe-inspiring canyons, when he painted the plains with waving grasses and erected noble forests of towering trees, he outdid it all by creating friends. Why not take a moment or two and thank someone today for being a friend to you?                                                                   
                                                                    
     May God bless you with all the friends you need, and may he turn you into a blessing by using you as a friend to others.                                                                    
                                                                    
                                                                    
 My sheep (believers) hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father who gave them to me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand. (John 10:27-29)

the scenes" look at our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me
in the left arm repeatedly with his index finger - until I hung up
the phone and gave him my full, undivided attention. "Did you know

eBooks section," he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages,
we ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the
main page for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=lockergnomedigit&path=tg/browse/-/551440/">Amazon's
eBooks</a>. Cool! "With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the imagination,
Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3,
these eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding
publishers we've encountered are hard to resist." Thank
you for helping us along, gang. My ultimate goal is to kick that
Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a day.

I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter
(both from Sonic Foundry) for donating a couple more prizes
for this year's <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex
conference</a>. Just by walking through the entrance with your
pass in hand, you'll be automatically entered to win one of the
copies of Sound Forge XP! And this software is no slouch; for home
users and professionals on a Windows OS, it's one of the best
audio editors around. If it can't do something you need to have
done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full
Lockergnome review from our Digital Media editor (Jake) at some
point in the future. Until then, feel free to
<a href="http://www.sonicfoundry.com/download/step2.asp?DID=257">download
the demo</a>. If I can ever decide on a digital video camera,
perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too. Melanie and
I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC
is at the top of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the
best, but I'm not really up for spending much more than $1000.
Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough.

<P>

As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit:
it's pretty darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can
"unsend" an e-mail message (but only if it was sent to another
America Online member and s/he hasn't read it yet). If you travel
often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone who just
needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a
little upset when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu.
Nowhere during the installation process did I see a way to opt out
of it. I'm not surprised; there are more advertisements on AOL
than there are from your average "free" Web page host. You may
have asked yourself: "What is Chris doing installing AOL in the
first place?!" I don't <a href="http://www.iblameyou.com/">blame
you</a>. No, hell did not freeze over. We've been doing tips for
their users on our show lately, and I decided to throw it on my
laptop for testing purposes. Perhaps 8.0 will be better?

<b>SEPopular v1.02 [2.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREE</b>

{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.

{Measure distance and angles} I was never very good in geometry... Pythagoras would be disappointed that I can never exactly remember his theorem. (What did a hippopotamus have to do with triangles anyway? That animal seems to be pretty round if you ask me...) Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale. Everything about MB-Ruler can be customized, including its size and color. Talk about an application that "measures up!"

{Fixing password problems} Now where did I put that password? I thought I had Outlook Express keeping track of it for me... If you use Outlook Express (for Windows 2000 or Windows XP) to check your e-mail, then this article is for you. Occasionally your password for Outlook Express is not retained, even though you have checked the "Remember Password" checkbox. To fix this particular issue, you will need Administrator privileges in order to make some modifications to your system's registry. The article contains steps for backing up your registry and, since you can cause a lot of accidental damage while tweaking the registry... I would recommend that you follow them.

<b>Re-route E-mail Forwarding Service</b>
<p>
<a href="http://www.re-route.com/" class="URL">http://www.re-route.com/</a>
<p>
Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!
s? Sounds like money well spent!

Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.

Quiz: Know your Cockney Rhyming Slang?

Cockney Rhyming Slang is alive and well with new terms being invented all
the time, according to the new Oxford Dictionary of Rhyming Slang being
published this week.
But do you know a Raquel Welch (belch) from a Billie Piper (windscreen
wiper)?

                               life-long pursuits

         On July 17th, 2001, DMITRY SKLYAROV, coder for the Russian
         software house ELCOMSOFT, was arrested while visiting the
         US. His crime: writing code that exposed flaws in Adobe's
         e-book security, in contravention of the USA's exciting new
         DMCA. In the next year, thanks to widespread protests, Adobe
         withdrew their call to prosecute the Russian hacker and
         Dmitry was freed. Elcomsoft is still in the dock for
         breaching Adobe's copy restriction routines. If the aim of
         the prosecution was to cow them into keeping quiet about
         security problems, it doesn't appear to have worked. On July
         12th, 2002, ELCOMSOFT posted to Bugtraq a flaw in Adobe's
         e-book security. Namely, that in Adobe's "lending library"
         web app for the Adobe Content Server, you can borrow a book
         for over twenty years (instead of three days) just by
         changing a hidden Web form value. The library site is just a
         demonstration app, so it's not a serious problem, but it
         does give Elcomsoft room for a catty little addendum. "Some
         time ago", they write "we have found much more serious
         problem with another Adobe software and reported it to the
         vendor; however, there was no response at all, and so we
         decided not to waste our time reporting this one (about the
         library) to Adobe". How much reaction do they want?

         We'll tread cautiously with this one, as it involves Vast
         Ageless Corporations Who Have Retained Counsel Living Where
         Their Glowing Eyesockets Used To Be. Just days before we
         read on Slashdot that zombie company FORGENT is demanding
         patent license fees for users of JPEG, we're contacted by
         someone who has received a similiarly threatening letter -
         this time, from the rather more established Lucent
         Technologies. The message reads: "After some market research
         it has come to our attention that some of your company's
         products may employ the JBIG/JPEG Standard. Therefore,
         Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, Lucent's licensing agent, is
         contacting your company regarding your interest in obtaining
         a license for patents." What follows is the usual demand for
         fees, dire threats if compliance is thwarted, requests that
         the guards seize the criminals and throw them in Patent
         Dungeon, etc. Now, Lucent's patents don't seem to be
         breached by a JPEG implementaton (although it's known that
         JBIG is patent-encumbered; hence JBIG-2). So why does Lucent
         bring up JPEG at all? A curious wording for sure, and we'd
         be interested to see if anyone else has been contacted in
         these terms. Mail us at tips@spesh.com if you have.

         Oh, is it time again already for Esquire's 50 Sharpest Men
         2002? Joy! Hidden among the usual suspects - which include
         Richard Dawkins ("scientist"), Kevin Warwick ("scientist"),
         Kevin Eldon ("comedian" - and KING OF HOBBIES), is one 
         Charlie Brooker (listed here as a "TV Go Home"). Merely 
         appearing in the list seems to have prompted the reclusive,
         unsmiling, and often violent comedian to hurredly post a 
         TVGoHome update from his pile of cardboard boxes near Soho,
         which is all to the good. But does he really deserve the title?
         What *is* sharpness? "In case your are [sic] in any doubt", 
         the site explains, "sharpness is, above all, an attitude". Now
         the dictionary says it's also "having a bitter taste", and
         "harshness of manner", and given that Hank, the Angry
         Drunken Dwarf is both unlisted and dead, we think Brooker's
         a show-in for the Web protest/mess-with-publisher's-heads
         vote. We urge you to vote now, express the will of the
         people, and win some vile perfume or a horrible watch.

         Yes, we have concerns about encountering Slashdot readers "au

         And yet, at the same time, we cannot look away. 7pm local

         at time of writing - an impressive 91 interested signups for 
         the London gathering (19 for Manchester, Leeds 17, Glasgow 11, 
         Birmingham 9, Liverpool 6, and so on). Usual warnings about 
         meeting your online "friends" are, we imagine, more than 
         usually applicable here - especially as no-one can work out 
         what the organisers are getting out of it. Spamming lists? 
         Kickbacks from the democratically selected venues? Or valuable

         Once again that silly 5K Web competition thing gets the
         headlines. And once again, we must rub its fatty, fatty chin
         against the honed shard of flint that is the 2002 1K
         MINIGAME 8-BIT CODING COMPETITION until it's shaved meek.
         1024 bytes is all you (must have) wrote: to enter, arrange
         them to form a working game on any 8-bit micro you choose.
         In response to complaints from last year, "middle class BBC
         Micro Fauntleroys" will be permitted, says last year's
         judge, Matt Westcott. More weakness is shown by permitting
         Atari 2600s, which have 2K cartridges, to enter (you must
         fill the last 1K with zeros), and also the TI99/4A which as
         everyone knows has sixteen bits. We do hope this doesn't end
         in Zork virtual machines or Postscript or something.

         the shelves in a 2-pack for 99p deal in selected branches of 
         Sainsbury's... as predicted in NTK 2001-08-10, KFC have taken 
         advantage of MCDONALD'S weakness in the KITKAT MCFLURRY arena, 
         and rolled out their identically-sized rival AVALANCHE (also 
         99p) with a freakish selection of toppings including chocolate 
         sauce, Cadbury's Flake, M&M's and Starburst Joosters. In a 
         non-ice-cream-related incident, CHARLOTTE LATIMER was the 
         first to contact us with a sighting of STARBURST "straight-
         out-of-the-1993-naming-dept" FLIPSTERS HARD CANDY (from 
         30p/pack): "pretty nice hard candies (peach, apple, raspberry 
         and forest fruits) with a yucky plastic-looking splodge on one 
         side that purports to offer some kind of creaminess (we 
         guess)", but still no news yet of the brand's other mutant 
         offspring: teardrop-shaped FRUITINESSE (from 49p), non-fish-
         flavoured gummy SEA MONSTERS (from 99p/bag), and STARBURST 
         CAKE BARS (UKP1.05 for pack of 5)... and finally, MIKE WALSH 
         of Finland remained nonplussed with last month's UK sighting 
         of an imported South African NESTLE SMARTIES IN MILKYBAR 
         CHOCOLATE, maintaining he bought a White "Ritter Sport" bar 
         with Smarties in, "in a branch of the (German) Spar chain in 
         Tenerife in January", and was generally disappointed by its 
         usability: "Smarties kept falling out", he complains. But 
         Nestle is innovating over here as well, with the imminent 
         arrival of WONKA XPLODER and GOLDEN CRUNCHER biscuits (79p/ 
         pack of 6) - replacing underperforming former NTK "Taste 
         Abominations" WONKA OOMPA sweets - and its first new chocolate 
         launch in 5 years, solid-looking would-be Dairy Milk-killer 
         NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p, available from July 29)...

       Need to Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that

       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.

RealNetworks Poses Challenge to Microsoft
By JOHN MARKOFF

SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 -- In a significant challenge to Microsoft,
RealNetworks plans to announce a new version of its software on Monday
that can distribute audio and video in a range of formats, including
Microsoft's own proprietary Windows Media.

The new software is intended for large media companies and other
corporations that need to send audio and video data to customers and
employees in a variety of different formats. But RealNetworks
acknowledged that it was possible that the company might incur
Microsoft's legal wrath.

Nevertheless, Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive who founded
RealNetworks as Progressive Networks in 1994, said he believed the
strategy was good for both Microsoft and consumers.

"A rational way for them to respond would be to say, `This is great,' "
he said. "That would be Microsoft of the future."

Mr. Glaser said his company, based in Seattle, had developed a version
of the Microsoft Media Server software that comes with the Windows
operating system.

He said RealNetworks' engineers had studied the data that was sent
between the Microsoft media server software and the Windows Media Player
program and recreated the technology needed to play files in the
Microsoft format. This method created a so-called clean-room version,
meaning the developers built the transmission software without any
knowledge about the underlying program.

Microsoft has adopted a similar strategy at several junctures,
Mr. Glaser said, reverse-engineering technologies like NetWare,
PostScript and JavaScript at different times.

Microsoft executives said the company currently licensed the Windows
Media Player technology to a variety of companies including Yahoo,
RealNetworks and the America Online unit of AOL Time Warner. But a
Microsoft executive said that a clean-room copy of the Windows server
technology could lead to quality and performance issues.

"It's kind of hard to speculate about the technology until we see it,"
said Dave Fester, the general manager of the Windows Media division. If
a company has not licensed the server software, he added, "we would need
to look at it and see what they're doing."

RealNetworks appears to be endeavoring to avoid being "Netscaped," a
reference to the fate that befell the Netscape Communications
Corporation when Microsoft decided to make an Internet browser, which
was pioneered commercially by Netscape, a standard part of the Windows
operating system. Netscape was later acquired by AOL Time
Warner. Microsoft's decision to build an Internet browser into Windows
and give it away at no additional cost led directly to a bitter
antitrust lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1997.

RealNetworks, which was a pioneer in the market for streaming media to
desktop personal computers, has been under growing pressure from
Microsoft, which is giving away both the server and Windows Media Player
program as part of its operating strategy. RealNetworks also faces
challenges from Apple Computer, which offers the QuickTime media player
as a part of its Macintosh OS X operating system and sells a more
full-featured player.

Moreover, in recent months Macromedia Inc., which makes the Flash
animation software used on many Web sites, has added video capabilities
to its technology, making it a potential rival.

RealNetworks is gambling that with a proliferation of different
standards and formats for video and audio, the media corporations that
make content available over the Internet will flock to a single system
that supports multiple types of data. The company is trying to shift the
focus of the competition from the PC desktop to the server, according to
analysts.

Several analysts said the RealNetworks shift in strategy could put
Microsoft on the defensive.

"Real has got the experience and sophistication to pull this off," said
Richard Doherty, the president of Envisioneering, a market research and
consulting firm based in Seaford, N.Y. "It will open up a new horse race."

Until now the companies have been engaged in a technology war to rapidly
increase the power and quality of each of their media players. At the
same time, they have competed over which of the programs are placed on
the desktops of personal computer users. RealNetworks claims to have
700,000 subscribers for pay services, but it is perceived as being
increasingly vulnerable, according to some analysts, because Microsoft
has included its Media Player as part of the Windows operating system,
which dominates the PC market.

There are dozens of data formats for playing audio and video on the
Internet, but the dominant ones are RealAudio and RealVideo from
RealNetworks, QuickTime from Apple, Windows Media from Microsoft and the
industry digital movie standards MPEG-2 and MPEG-4.

Microsoft and RealNetworks are currently locked in a close race for
desktop media player leadership. In the first quarter of this year,
according to survey data collected by Jupiter Research, a market
research firm based in New York, RealNetworks' RealOne Player had a 29.1
percent share of media players, while Microsoft's Windows Media Player
had a 28.2 percent share. Apple's Quicktime player was third, with a
12.2 percent.

The new server software from RealNetworks is part of a version of the
company's media server that is to be introduced on Monday and which will
be called the Helix Universal Server. RealNetworks said it would offer
performance data based on a test it financed at an independent testing
service, KeyLabs, that indicate that the Helix software can, under some
conditions, deliver up to four times the speed of the Windows Media
Server in Microsoft's operating system. (Software servers are programs
that run on powerful computers and can send streams of digital
information to many computer users simultaneously.)

At a news conference scheduled to be held in San Francisco, RealNetworks
is also expected to announce that it plans to make the Helix software
available as part of a strategy known as community source, which will
make it possible for RealNetworks partners and competitors to take
advantage of the original programmers' instructions.

RealNetworks is to announce a range of partners, including Hitachi,
Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Deutsche Telekom, NEC, Nokia, Cisco Systems,
Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Palm, Texas Instruments and others. These
partners could then incorporate the software into their own hardware and
software products.

Under the licensing strategy, companies will be able to freely gain
access to the underlying code that the Helix program is based on, but
they will still pay a licensing fee when they sell commercial products
based on the technology.

The community-source approach to software, which was pioneered by Sun to
distribute its Java programming language, is a variation upon the
original free software or open-source approach which has confounded the
software industry in recent years.

While open-source software can be freely shared, with some restrictions,
the community-source approach is more restrictive and yet still tries to
persuade others to collaborate and add innovative ideas.

Other large technology companies including Sun, I.B.M. and Apple, have
all now adopted variations on such open-source strategy, with varying
results. In Sun's case, the company has been criticized because, while
Java has become an industry standard, the company has not been the
principal financial beneficiary in many cases.

RealNetworks is trying to strike a balance between opening up its
technology to persuade others to participate and innovate and not losing
control of the technology entirely, Mr. Glaser said. "We think we've
struck the balance well," he said.

Analysts said the strategy shift by RealNetworks was likely to shake up
the industry. "The moment you've open-sourced something you've cornered
your competitor," said Matthew Berk, an analyst a Jupiter Research. "To
date this stuff has been very proprietary. Opening it up makes it
accessible to creative and gifted programmers who will come up with wild
stuff that the companies have never considered."

Mr. Glaser said he expected other companies to produce technology that
would rival RealNetworks' commercially as a result of the
community-source strategy.

One possibility is that companies such as Sun or I.B.M. could decide to
add the Helix technology of RealNetworks as a standard component of
their operating systems. Although RealNetworks might not get a
significant financial benefit from such an arrangement it could
contribute to making its Helix software a de facto industry standard.

Mr. Glaser said he had struck upon the idea of making his media server
software open source while visiting with an executive from Nokia, the
world's largest cellphone maker.

"Taking all of this stuff beyond the PC has been a huge motivation for
us," he said. When he realized that Nokia was interested in deploying
the software technology on as many as 30 to 40 different types of
phones, he realized that RealNetworks did not have enough programming
talent to support the effort.

"I told him, `I don't think we have enough engineers even if you guys
were willing to pay us,' " he said.

That touched off a search for an alternative way of having the two
companies cooperate.

Real takes the open-source route 
By Jim Hu 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
July 22, 2002, 1:55 PM PT

RealNetworks on Monday unveiled a new open-source version of its
streaming media technology that supports multiple file formats for audio
and video, including those that use Microsoft's Windows Media technology. 

The new campaign, dubbed "Helix," and first reported by The New York
Times, marks one of the most ambitious moves in the company's
history. RealNetworks is simultaneously releasing technology without
permission that plugs in to Microsoft's competing software and is
raising the hood on much of its own software technology to "open source"
developers or anyone else who wants to look. 

The twin moves raise the risk of lawsuits and renewed competition --
potentially even from Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft itself, once it
gets a look under the hood at RealNetworks' technology. But it marks a
dramatic, potential way for a company watching its market share diminish
to regain momentum and support across an industry where many other
players remain skeptical of Microsoft's power.

"It's a very bold move on the part of Real," said Michael Gartenberg, a
research director for analyst firm Jupiter Research. "This was a shot
fired by Real and fired directly at Redmond." 

The move is the latest in a series of strategic twists and turns that
has made RealNetworks one of the only companies to survive direct
Microsoft competition for years. While the company has expanded into
paid subscription content business, its software and streaming media
infrastructures have been under increasing pressure from Microsoft,
which has deemed multimedia to be one of the major drives under the
latest versions of its Windows operating system. 

Real's Helix announcement mainly involves the technology that allows
media files to move from place to place over the Internet. RealNetworks
and Microsoft both produce servers that allow video and audio to be
streamed from a content company such as CNN or NBC to a personal
computer. Real has charged for this software, while Microsoft has given
it away for free. 

In April, RealMedia reached 17 million at-home viewers, compared with
Windows Media at 15.1 million and Apple Computer's QuickTime at 7.3
million, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. At work, Windows Media drew
about 12.2 million unique viewers, compared with RealMedia's 11.6
million and QuickTime's 5 million. 

Real's own new product, called the Universal Server, will allow one
server to stream Real's technology, Microsoft files, Apple Computer's
QuickTime, and others. Most other competing products do not support
competitors' technology. 

"When you have all these different platforms, and all these different
protocols, it gets unmanageable," RealNetworks' Rob Glaser said at a
high-glitz press conference in San Francisco announcing the product. "A
lot of what (this technology) is about is breaking those bottlenecks and
making convergence really converge." 

To make the new product compatible with Microsoft files, however, the
company pursued a risky strategy known as "reverse engineering," in
which developers examine a competitor's product to see how it works and
try to create something that works just like it. 

Glaser said that engineers worked entirely in a "clean room"
environment, meaning that they had no access to actual Microsoft
code. Had they simply copied code, they could be liable for patent
infringement. The resulting product simply mimics the way that
Microsoft's files are sent across networks and allows a Windows Media
player to receive the file. 

Other companies have been sued for simply copying a competitor's code
and putting it in their own products. But RealNetworks says it's not
worried about Microsoft lawsuits, because it took precautions to do all
development in the "clean room" environment. Microsoft itself has
engaged in this kind of legal reverse engineering. 

Analysts say Microsoft, which still faces antitrust lawsuits, is in no
position to sue in any case. 

"This is a very tenuous time for Microsoft," Gartenberg said. "This is
not a time in Microsoft's history when it can be seen as trying to do to
Real what it did to Netscape." 

The influential giant?

Certainly, Monday's announcement acknowledges Microsoft's influence in
media technology, something Glaser and Real have often been loathe to do. 

Microsoft was quick to spin Monday's announcement as further validation
of its strength in the marketplace. 

"It's an admission of RealNetworks that it's important for them to
support Windows Media and that we're now the leading player among home
and work users," said Michael Aldridge, lead product manager for
Microsoft's Windows Digital Media division. 

Aldridge added that RealNetworks currently has a licensing agreement for
its media player to support Windows audio and video formats. However,
RealNetworks and Microsoft do not have an agreement to allow the server
to deliver Windows Media formats to end users, which is what
RealNetworks trying to do. 

Aldridge declined to comment on RealNetworks' replication of Microsoft's
technology. 

In addition to its own new product, Real has promised to give away
source code to much of the underlying technology for streaming
media. That stops short of the actual file format, or "codec" itself,
but will provide the open-source community and other companies with
powerful new tools to build their own streaming media players or
software. 

Glaser said he wouldn't initially make the software code that mimics
Microsoft's streaming available but that he was considering the idea. A
first chunk of code underlying the RealNetworks multimedia player
software will be released in 90 days. Other code, including the basic
functions of its streaming media server and encoder, will be released by
the end of the year, the company said. 

The company's plan to reveal its source code--the basic instructions
underlying the software--echoes similar moves made by Netscape
Communications to defend against Microsoft. In March 1998, Netscape took
the bold step of opening its source code to allow software developers to
help create the next generation of its popular browser. 

James Barksdale, then CEO of Netscape, said the move would allow the
company to "tap into a virtually unlimited developer talent pool."
Instead, the effort, which has evolved into the Mozilla.org project, hit
considerable roadblocks, and Microsoft overtook Netscape in market
share.

We have done a great job of having teams work around the clock to
deliver security fixes for any problems that arise. Our responsiveness
has been unmatched - but as an industry leader we can and must do
better... Going forward, we must develop technologies and policies that
help businesses better manage ever larger networks of PCs, servers and
other intelligent devices, knowing that their critical business systems
are safe from harm. Systems will have to become self-managing and
inherently resilient. We need to prepare now for the kind of software
that will make this happen, and we must be the kind of company that
people can rely on to deliver it.

The problem with SOAP is that it tries to escape from the Web interface.
It deliberately attempts to suck, mostly because it is deliberately
trying to supplant CGI-like applications rather than Web-like
applications.  It is simply a waste of time for folks to say that "HTTP
allows this because I've seen it used by this common CGI script."  If we
thought that sucky CGI scripts were the basis for good Web
architectures, then we wouldn't have needed a Gateway Interface to
implement them.  In order for SOAP-ng to succeed as a Web protocol, it
needs to start behaving like it is part of the Web.  That means, among
other things, that it should stop trying to encapsulate all sorts of
actions under an object-specific interface.  It needs to limit its
object-specific behavior to those situations in which object-specific
behavior is actually desirable.  If it does not do so, then it is not
using URI as the basis for resource identification, and therefore it is
no more part of the Web than SMTP.

After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: 

    Squid on the Mantelpiece 

    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the "squid on the mantelpiece." 

    Card Tricks in the Dark 

    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. 
    (Attr. Tim Powers) 

I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get 
some links up before I hit the sack. Until tomorrow! Link[1] Discuss[2]

THE BUZZ ABOUT THE UPCOMING MOVIE

People are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in "The Secret Life of Zoey."
Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:
"My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe
 rson I can be."

  Japanese Crime Noir in DivX Video
  ---------------------------------

  A wide variety of innovative studios and film distributors have
  been using DivX video-on-demand technology to sell downloadable
  DivX titles online since August of last year. One of the many
  interesting films currently available is the Japanese crime
  thriller "Nobody" from DivX partner Vanguard Cinema. Called "a
  triumph" by the New York Times, "Nobody" is an action-packed
  thriller-noir that tells a story of an escalating cycle of
  violence and revenge. In the tradition of international crime
  thrillers like "La Femme Nikita" and "Tokyo Fist," "Nobody" takes
  the viewer through a labyrinth of suspense and carnage without
  release until the very end.

Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.

The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.

But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.

SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier "manager"*, for  pushing them to carry out their "gay" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.

Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.

So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.

All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?

Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.

* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy
who goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.

Barbie has been made over as a Bond girl:  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/bondbarbie.jpg] As James Bond, Ken 
    has matured nicely with rooted hair, with slight silvering at his temples, 
    wearing a midnight blue tuxedo, and authentic recreation of the classic tux 
    by Brioni, the famed clothier. Linda Hemming, the award winning costume 
    designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She 
    wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red 
    shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal 
    lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell 
    phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the 
    premiere of "Die Another Day," the new James Bond film. Bond, James Bond, 
    meet Barbie, just Barbie...

<title> My dear sir, in the words of a man who ought to have been an editor of to-day, 'The public be damned!' What I looked to you for was not your idea of what somebody else wanted you to write, but your expression of what you yourself want to write. About hoboes. About railroad wrecks. About cowmen or peddlers or waterside toughs or stage-door Johnnies, or ward politicians, or school-teachers, or life. Not pink teas.

<!--Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not deceive anybody a particle.  Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy in love as in law.  He was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one.  His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see--well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction.  The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him. Not until after the dinner did Banneker remind his host of their understanding. You haven't forgotten that I'm here on business? -->

The feeling in Harley's voice was real, and the boy was thrilled by it and the situation. Every natural impulse in him responded. It was the chivalrous thing for him to do, and an easy one. He could send a speech as fast as the fastest man living could deliver it. He rose without a word, his heart beating with thoughts of the coming battle, in which he felt proudly that he should be a victor, and made his way to the telegraphers' box.

<b>180 MUST-KNOW TECH TERMS</b> Anyone who's ever been asked to explain a 
tech term only to be left stumbling through a plausible explanation will

tech references, to clear descriptions of day-to-day definitions you may 
already know (but not know how to define). These 180 definitions will leave 
you talking the talk of the office geek without giving up your entire social 
calendar to extended sessions in front of a CRT. Even with the refresh rate

When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the 
unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 
90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of 
things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is 
it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? 
Omaha has started a <a 
href="http://www.ci.omaha.ne.us/streets/restrictdate.asp">10 
year project</a> on Dodge street, which more or less divides 
the city in half east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to 
the construction disaster at 90th and Dodge are being felt 
by nearby businesses. A <a 
href="http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/news/81302_bb1.html">bank 
is fighting back</a> in a creative way, replacing random $20 
and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50 and $20 notes 
respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. 
And I just drove right by the place.

<p>The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better 
right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between 
Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 
20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress 
they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's 
probably the fastest moving highway construction I've seen 
during my travels throughout Iowa over the years. As you 
travel to <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a> 
from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on 
construction at <a 
href="http://www.ctre.iastate.edu/iowaroadwork/">this handy 
site</a> put up by the Iowa Department of Transportation.

<p>Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client is a free download that 
allows computers running Windows 98, Windows Millennium 
Edition (Me), or Windows NT Workstation 4.0 to use Layer 
Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) connections with Internet 
Protocol security (IPSec). The combination of L2TP and 
IPSec, known as L2TP/IPSec, is a highly secure technology 
for making remote access virtual private network (VPN) 
connections across public networks such as the Internet. 
Microsoft L2TP/IPSec VPN Client also provides support for 
IPSec Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal.

<b>Iomega Intros 750MB Zip</b>

<p><a class="url" href="http://www.iomega.com/zip">http://www.iomega.com/zip</a>

<p>I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost 
and small capacity. I know many people that still use Zip 
drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz drive from time to 
time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and 
media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has 
bumped the capacity to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed 
the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's 
still worth a look for those that need a fast removable 
media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice 
some speed for the reliability of optical media. But that's 
just me.

<b>Technical Overview of .NET File Services</b>

<p>.NET Server is more than Windows 2000 with a look of 
Windows XP, of that you can be sure. Common sense has 
finally won, with the developers delivering many more 
command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this 
isn't the only thing being brought to the .NET table. 
Improvements in DFS, defrag, chkdsk and EFS just scratch the 
surface. New WHQL processes are being established for 
antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the 
OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and 
promised improvements in the File Replication Service should 
make managing storage easier and more flexible.

<b>P4 Performance Goes to Court</b>

<p><a class="url" href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp">http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp</a>

<p>A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a 
small group of PC owners that are miffed about the 
performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by Intel, HP 
and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the 
overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem 
to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on 
the part of the customer, if you ask me. This is one of 
those subjective questions that will come down to fancy 
lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed 
everything the TV commercials had to say, then the litigants 
got what they had coming. One beer tastes better than the 
next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. This 
general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, 
as have crash test results on the part of the government and 
third-party organizations. Should we be suing auto makers 
when someone dies in a 5-star rated vehicle? That Volvo will 
save your life, ya know. Does this set an unreasonable 
expectation? Only if you consider advertising an education.

Lennon killer seeks parole again

The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just "a picture on an album cover" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.

========================================================
Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:

To whom it may concern,

I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70s & 80s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?

Sincerely,

Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

Last week, <a href="http://www.axialis.com/">Axialis Software</a>
released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon
editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I
asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one.
Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a
nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on
the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons
between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE]
DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon Contest), and
one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt</a>,
KarmaGirl from <a href="http://www.wincustomize.com/">WinCustomize</a>, Voodoo from
<a href="http://www.neowin.net/">Neowin</a>, and Marc from
Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not
only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some
of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the
software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't
hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least
fame and free software.

Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new
(unofficial) <a href="http://www.frysianfools.com/ggsearch/">Google SearchTool</a>
today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry,
I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave
<a href="http://www.outertech.com/product.php?product=3">Cacheman</a>
another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a
great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good.
The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow,
my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is
<a href="http://www.repligator.com/">Repligator 9.0</a>. It gives
me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital
photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest
Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine,
which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just
wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and "12 Mistakes
Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy" is available for FREE
with the purchase of ANY <a href="http://www.gnometomes.com/">GnomeTome</a> (including our 50
freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know
as much as s/he should.

<p>

There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on <a href="http://mp3.lockergnome.com/">Emusic</a> now. They inked a
deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any
more to get access to even <a href="http://mp3.lockergnome.com/">more MP3s</a>. This is the ONLY
way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will
eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a
place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters
knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has
encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is
NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains
flexible and not controlled by any one company. This
<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1107-941111.html">Palladium</a>
thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the
service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives
people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate
to admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM.
I best not find out that you're part of the problem.

{Recipe lister} The best thing about this recipe holder? The
conversion calculator. I've always wondered how many teaspoons
were in a gallon. There are a few delicious recipes already
included, to help you start your collection of favorites.
Everything is nicely divided into categories, too. Need a salad?
Then click &quot;Soups &amp; Salads.&quot; (Easy!) You can also make shopping
lists. The printing capability is nice too, since I'm assuming
most of you don't keep your computer next to the stove. &quot;If you
have an up-to-date computer with Win2000, XP, or 98SE with the
latest version of IE, then you can download the version with no
runtime support since your computer has all the necessary files.&quot;

{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have
really cool names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is
simply referred to as &quot;moon?&quot; We should change it to something
catchier, like &quot;Joey Joe-Joe Junior Shabbadu.&quot; Don't mind me, I
was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single &quot;day&quot; lasts on different
planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on
Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree
for longer than we thought.

&quot;VNC (an abbreviation for Virtual Network Computing) is a great
client / server software package allowing remote network access to
graphical desktops. With VNC, you may allow yourself to access
your machine from everywhere provided that your machine is
connected to the Internet. VNC is free (released under the GNU
General Public License) and it's available on most platforms. The
original VNC distribution can be obtained at the AT&amp;T research
labs site. Here you can find enhanced version of VNC, called
TightVNC (grown from the VNC Tight Encoder project), which is
optimized to work over slow network connections such as low-speed
modem links. While original VNC may be very slow when your
connection is not fast enough, with TightVNC you can work remotely
almost in real time in most environments. Besides bandwidth
optimizations, TightVNC also includes many other improvements,
optimizations and bug fixes over VNC.&quot;

<B>Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software</b>
    <br>Scribbled by Pat Wong
<P>
 <A CLASS=URL HREF="http://popup.jscentral.com/">http://popup.jscentral.com/</A>
<P>
I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation
menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use.
<P>
Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

    <br>Unearthed by a Gnomie
<P>
 <A CLASS=URL HREF="http://www.calculator.com/">http://www.calculator.com/</A>
<P>
{Calculate it} Calculators aren't just for adding and subtracting
numbers or spelling silly phrases by turning the calculator upside
down. How about figuring out the financing on your new car? What
about the seeding rates for your wheat farm? Perhaps you
programmers out there need a nice HEX calculator. And, of course,
what football fan wouldn't like to calculate the passing rates for
his or her favorite quarterback? If it seems like I'm all over the
map here, it's because this site provides links to all kinds of
calculator sites for all kinds of people. Trust me: it all adds up
to a unique and useful site.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: &quot;In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50.  However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges.&quot; For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found
IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

Jeremy Zawodny[1] who works at Yahoo Finance offers an RSS 0.91 feed for every 
stock. It's a beta feature. Here's the feed for Microsoft[2] and one for 
Marimba[3]. Thanks to Jon Udell[4] for the pointer. Nice. Jon also notes that 
Microsoft doesn't show up too strong in the weblog world and describes[5] a 
conversation with John Montgomery about this. What a small world. John and I 
got to know each other when we did the work on SOAP in the late 90s, and weblog 
software is one of the major reasons we were interested in SOAP. So close, but 
so far. But it's never too late!

	Aren't Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal 
opportunity already?  Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded 
equal opportunity in workplaces presently.  

	Equal opportunity means: "For every man, woman and 
child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability 
will take them."  Statistics, mostly gathered by government 
studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all 
other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, 
corporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist 
an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of 
their potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.

	Let's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are 
employed in universities.  Their average performance has been 
outstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?  

	University administrators are recruited almost exclusively 
from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in 
universities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + 
professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the 
opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  
Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, 
for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black 
administrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white 
(non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is 
only 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out 
for yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - <www.ed.gov/NCES/ 
pubs/96323.html>, Table B-1f.

	The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 
"enlightened" academic world.  The situation in the corporate 
world, state and federal governments is worse.  

	In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two 
major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and 
help make our beloved nation "a more perfect Union."   There has 
already been progress on account of that strategy.  Behold how the 
glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing
significantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in 
the 2000 election.

80-20 is a national, nonpartisan, Political Action Committee 
dedicated to winning equal opportunity and justice for all 
Asian Pacific Americans through a SWING bloc vote, ideally 
directing 80% of our community's votes and money to the 
presidential candidate endorsed by the 80-20, who better 
represents the interests of all APAs.  Hence, the name "80-20" was 
created.

   <font size="3"><b>Why we're changing our publishing schedule</b></font>

<br><br>

Dear Reader,
<p>
As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
<p>
Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  
<p>
Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
<p>
Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
<p>
For now, the new schedule is being called a "test," which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. 
<p>
I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on <a href="http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=34-pJpSIcd8ldb3QT23_tvVyn4IcgyR" >CNET Radio</a> every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

David Coursey<br>
Executive Editor<br>
AnchorDesk

UNITED WE FALL?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout.
American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent
company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for 
Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September,
but it's not much consolation to airline employees,
shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.

The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of
American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay
off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight
amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make
for longer layovers. "In the past, airlines were loath to have
longer connection times because flights were listed in travel
agents' computers by elapsed time," said the Journal. "Now,
online booking tools and search engines most often list flights
by price, not time." In this age of penny-pinching, American's
worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US
Air and United. 

Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its
parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster.
Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price
may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an
increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board. "The ATSB expects an
applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions 
to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S.
taxpayers' interests," said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for
uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, 
which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring 
$498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the
36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor
frustration. 

The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and
non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. "The U.S.
government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and
federal loan guarantees" while "European authorities have acted
more wisely," letting Swissair and Sabena "go to the wall," said 
the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should 
let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline
industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and
Canada 3000. Paging Charles Darwin to the white courtesy
phone... - Jen Muehlbauer

SLEEPING WITH THE PENGUIN
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which opened yesterday in
San Francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellows ever to 
lie down with a stuffed penguin: Microsoft and Sun. These are
companies that once referred to Linux as a "bathtub of code"
(Sun) and "a cancer" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown
paper the San Jose Mercury News.

Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute
numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on
server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in
the entire year.

Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at 
the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the
Seattle Times this way: "Microsoft executive Peter Houston
wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld
... until he heard about the pie cannon."

Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft 
will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- "a place where 
you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes,"
deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: 
"Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to
grow."

Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press
release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus
Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon
Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to
scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a
version of Linux, to be called "Solinux." How time does make
April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon 
Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems
demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first
general-purpose servers running Linux.

The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude
toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but
to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some
of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it.
"Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun
servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running
Linux," Poletti reported. And you thought Microsoft hated Linux?

Feorag writes from Scotland: "You probably haven't heard of John Otway, but he 
has a small and devoted following here. He did a limited issue CD and asked his 
fans to vote on which track _they'd_ like to see as a single. The one they 
picked just entered the UK charts at number 9! Bet that'll piss off the major 
record labels, especially as the marketing budget was probably about zero. I 
might just watch Top of the Pops this week." Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks,

We did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with 
Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV 
recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on 
fair use and copyfights. Glenn "802.11b Networking News" Fleishman took great 
notes through the talk: 

    Dan: Tim, you're a "content or copyright holdertalk about these issues." 

    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. 
    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is 
    wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over 
    for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the 
    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. 

    Oblivion is fate of most books: "Piracy would be the best thing for those 
    books." People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally 
    like to respect the rights of creators. "Piracy is a marginal act; it takes 
    away some of the cream." 

    Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a 
    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a 
    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often 
    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and 
    position in bookstores. 

    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will 
    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? 

    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media 
    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're 
    stuck for a long time with "some mistakes."

The legendary Clarion Writers' Workshop -- of which I am an alumnus, class of 
'92 -- has spun out another satellite branch (Clarion West, in Seattle, has 
been going for some years now). The new workshop, Clarion South, will be held 
in Queensland, Australia, in 2004, so that antipodeans can also attend 
science-fiction bootcamp without travelling to America. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_
Thanks, Pat!_)

Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.

Jon Hanna, on the RSS-DEV list, says[1] that RSS, was "not designed to be of 
any particular use to bloggers, aggregators, or metadata providers." This is 
not true. Half of RSS 0.91 was scriptingNews format[2], which was totally

Dear Sir / Madam

If you are fed up of being 'ripped off' by the British government every time you buy your tobacco, then you should visit our website, where you can now buy 4 cartons of cigarettes, or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco from as little as 170 Euros (approx 105 pounds), inclusive of delivery by registered air mail from our office in Spain.  

Why pay more???

Visit our website at
http://www.smokesdirect.com/?ID=2

Best regards
Sales Department

Teresa's written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that Tyco's crooked 
CEO spent "6,000 on a shower curtain, $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $2,900 on 
coat hangers, $5,960 on bedsheets and $2,200 for a wastebasket." 

    Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for 
    your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do 
    so, practically essential. Then they explain how: 

    "Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed," said Joel Joves, a designer with 
    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. "If you have a fabulous study 
    or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with 
    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a 
    room." 

    That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous 
    wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying.

>>From Ed Felten's "Freedom to Tinker" site, regarding the TinkleToonz Musical 
Potty.: 

    This handy toilet training aid offers a "magical, musical land of potty 
    training," by playing a tune whenever liquid is deposited in it. Since it 
    plays digital audio, it qualifies for regulation as a "digital media 
    device" under the Hollings CBDTPA. If the CBDTPA passes, any newly 
    manufactured TinkleToonz Musical Potties will have to incorporate 
    government-approved copy protection technology.

Hi There,

I wanted to spread this good karma to you.

This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.

I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.

I am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.

Please help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!



Tan E.G.

@pls: Click www.blessing-people.com    Go there to feel his energy!!

===================================
* Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested Butte

All but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
others.

This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.

===================================
* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent

The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
http://64.78.49.204/

The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).

The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.

Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
beginning of the book.

The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
appear in December.

===================================
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow

Available at:
http://64.78.49.204/

Chapters 1-4 are finished

===================================
* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/

Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find.  It's
based on the book "Thinking in Java," which was created as the
seminar evolved.

Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
* $1,950 for payments received after October 12th

===================================
* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/

Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
into maintainable applications. 

Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
the seminar to include the latest J2EE features.

You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
your solutions.

Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
* $2,300 for payments received after October 26th

===================================
* New seminars

Bill Venners and I just finished giving the last "Objects &
Patterns" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time.

We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
Design Patterns in Java
(Drawing primarily from "Thinking in Patterns")

Designing Objects & Systems
This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
projects.

We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned.

===================================

Subject: NEWS: GNU/DEVELOPMENT... intl orgns take a close look at GNU/Linux
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:42 GMT

GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX

>From Frederick Noronha

INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
immense promise it holds out to the Third World.

But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? 

>From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
earnings.

United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
<radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.

infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
both the public and private sector.

This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
e-Government and related fields.

Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.

ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.

See http://www.egovos.org/

OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
======================

Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
tools. 

Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. 

It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.

UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information
Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
and culture.

It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for "revising,
updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal" as well as for
including new basic documents. 

"This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"
said Dauphin. 

Check out the sites at

UNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/)
UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/)
UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)
UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)

NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
======================

Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. 

CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
(GPL license). 

See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml

Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
related issues.

"We want to see how we can further this cause in the region," APDIP's Shahid
Akhtar told this correspondent.

Niranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based
in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
"Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries".

This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.

This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
and lives of these countries.

CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
======================

In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. 

Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.

Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.

Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
varsities, military installations and within government. 

Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
government sector.

On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
news.

GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)

"The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
to the Internet and use technology more effectively," says Dirk Slater
<dirk@welfarelaw.org>. 

While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. 

Despite many "digital divide" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
in low-income communities, access is still an issue. 

Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
homes. 

LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.

"We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.

LINC protagonists say they had also been "troubled" by the frequent problems
that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. "Giving
a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
projects but had limited success," says Slater. 

LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
organizations that LINC serves. 

"Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
details of our experiences for others doing similar projects," LINC
explains.

LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.

Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
support.

"We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
effectively," said Slater.

To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC
Project Linux pages at <http://www.lincproject.org/toolkit/linux>

NEED TO NETWORK
===============

Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.

Says Pillai: "The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. 

"Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
more symbiosis with them," says he. 

Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
"http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines," says he. 

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. "Do look
for symbiosis opportunities there too," he suggests. 

"I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
work and get fruits out faster," he adds.

Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT

Dear friends,

Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? 

Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.

Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 

It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN

Im a man of my 40s and I really know my stuff.  I dont drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple 3.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores

Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
"We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today," said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
"We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously," she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.

Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.

complete collection of debugging tools <a href="http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=43-coL5IBJAW17ylrk9Z5VKc-3P0BcR" >here</a>, and put away the
can of Raid.<p>

Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
for ease of distribution.<p>

Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and
   decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX
   control. The control provides easy access to individual files
   stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within
   the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual
   files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to
   any directory, and the control's memory management allows any
   size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant
   memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly
   from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files
   with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor
   for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server
   Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and all
   languages that use ActiveX controls.

Distribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with
   VB-PowerWrap. VB-PowerWrap embeds all dependent and
   non-dependent files into the executable of your VB program,
   including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,
   to create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans
   a VB project, wraps the appropriate files, and creates a
   self-contained file for distribution. In addition,
   VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and registers
   appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It
   works with Visual Basic 4, 5, and 6.

Date: Not supplied

I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].

I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:

_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._

Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. 

Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?

"I told you so." never felt so good.

Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.
