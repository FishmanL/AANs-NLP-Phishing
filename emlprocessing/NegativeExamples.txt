If I have any RPMS in

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/

that could be useful to some one with a real apt repository or someone who wants to
maintain a package, be it known I am not selfish :)

I found stuff I thought would later get popular so I would not have to maintain the
RPMs for them after they hit the big time. Gnump3d is an exapmple of this.

So if anyone is psyched, go for it. If so, let me know so I can get the RPMs from
you in the future.

[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically
 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]

OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and
/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that
I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For the
record, here's how it all works:

  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any "junk mail
    condition" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)
    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it
    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as
    "message from known spammer" (reject after every RCPT TO command),
    "no message-id header", and "8-bit chars in subject" (both rejected
    after the message headers/body are read).

    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest
    are:
      - don't check for 8-bit chars in "From" header -- the vast
        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin
      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a
        verifiable email address in at least one of "From", "Reply-to",
        and "Sender") as late as possible, because it requires DNS
        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that
        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS
        lookups timeout)

  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those
    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients
    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This
    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder
    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the
    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject
    the message.

    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now
    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name
    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the
    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is
    retained in saved messages.)

    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py
    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew
    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows
    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is
    basically this:
      if virus:
          folder = "virus"
      else:
          run through SpamAssassin
          if score >= 10.0:
              folder = "rejected-spam"
          elif score >= 5.0:
              folder = "caught-spam"

    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.
    By far the biggest folder will be "accepted" -- the server handles
    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk
    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually
    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to
    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)

  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message
    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,
    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)
    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep
    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair
    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,
    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)
    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called
    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB
    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When
    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --
    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by
    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry
    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf
    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the
    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we
    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
    body.

    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is
    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP
    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This
    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and
    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam
    detectors.  Tim?

Happy harvesting --

That is not really an option, as I want the _latest_ KDE, not simply
4.4. I contribute to KDE and it is important for me to be on the
latest version. I cannot be on a distro that is perpetually a few
point releases behind.

Thanks, Liam! I am still weighing my options, including Debian-based
distros that may be more up to date. I am currently on Kubuntu, but
the 10.04 release is simply terrible and I'm looking for a new distro.
Suse would be my next choice, but I prefer Debian-based.

That does not seem to be entirely true as was mentioned elsewhere in this=20

To truly get forward with this one it appears to me that way more=20
developers are needed. Who then would have less or no time to work on=20
improving KDE 4.

I will stick with KDE 4 - as long as it - as a whole - does get better=20
from release to release. It already got better. It already takes longer=20
than with KDE 3 to get as stable and nice to work with as KDE 3.5.10, but=20
with help of everyone it eventually will get there. And KDE 3.5.10 had=20
issues as well. Especially with KMail that Boyd is so interested in. KMail=

as of KDE 4.3 *and* 4.4 appears to be way more stable to me regarding that=

annoying index handling issues. And it has been improved a lot by Thomas=20
McGuire and others. Okular is fine, Dolphin is fine, KWrite, Kate are fine,=

Dragon player is quite fine, Amarok is quite fine lots of other apps are=20
fine. I think mainly Akonadi, Nepomuk, Plasma, a bit also Phonon needs=20
quite some more stabilization and performance work.

The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up. 

    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed "GPRS" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.) 

    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on "enterprise" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, "Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 
    34-year-old demographic." 

I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)

I don't know about this /particular/ mood, but I have used
neuro-conditioning with aiding children in stressful
life-circumstances.

Basically, you somehow evoke the state you want, and when you get it,
you do something odd, anything at all will do, but I used a gentle
"vulcan grip" on their shoulder.  Later, when faced with the
uncomfortable situation, you can retrieve /part/ of that earlier more
desireable state by giving them the pinch; it's not perfect (like you
get with simpler brains) but it is an inescapable effect.

This is probably the neuro-effect that leads to performance-enhancing
superstitions such as Bob Dylan not performing without his favourite
jean jacket: Because it provides the cue to a more relaxed mental
state, he really does play better with it than without it.

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.

Downgrading is not supported. Changing the apt-config just means that=20
the apt-files don't reflect the state of your system (as mentioned=20
elsewhere in this thread). It will *not* fix your problem.
You can of course uninstall the package and reinstall a previous version =

directly from its deb. To get that deb, you can use snapshot.debian.org=20
or get it from the testing or stable repos.

There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and

be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or

So have I.  I didn't mean to imply otherwise.  I looked at them for decidin=

on reiserfs, then I replicated the results on my own hardware using bonnie+=

before restoring my backups.

I also look around for results about once a year, to see if much has change=

These have significant overhead over file system-specific methods.  They ar=

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks,
Dave

Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other
than put up the ftp version, but surely they
can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy and
giving it to me?

What is the GPL all about then?

But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not
theirs to BSD!

Nobody can oblige them to give away anything
other than ftp - I'm not asking for that. I'm
asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange
for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of
the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of
pints?).


What does the GPL mean now?


I don't want their 60 days of free email support
or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for
it).

Are you setting an icon on the window? We previously had a bug in Java 6 =

copy of your app via <http://bugreporter.apple.com> and some steps to =
reproduce, we should be able to quickly determine what the issue is.

about:config
browser.identity.ssl_domain_display
is probably what you are looking for (and it is a security feature)

Right.

I never do that way. I always first "umount" the device and then, I 
remove the stick, but not the reverse. Removable media has to be done 
that way, to prevent data loss or flash drive damage, or that is what 
manufacturers say :-?

I had the same problem some days ago. Just have a look in your 
~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf which pinentry will be called and have a look on 
your system, which pinentry is installed.

Razor/Client.pm is part of Razor v1. You've installed Razor v2.
Spamassassin's current release only works with v1. Although IIRC
the current CVS code works with v2.

It does/ did help, thank you.  I just pulled down virtuoso-minimal, and 
that dragged in a few more libraries, so hopefully that will shut 
nepomuk from complaining at me each time I logon.

Thanks mate - appreciate your help.

OK - I've yet to dive into the latest round of changes, but I plan to.
I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.

I just updated to the latest CVS - I had been running a build from June.  
Hitting the Flist button gives the following traceback:

syntax error in expression "int(17+1+(222-)*(19-17-2)/(224-))"
    while executing
"expr int($minLine+1+($msgid-$minMsg)*($maxLine-$minLine-2)/($maxMsg-$minMsg))"
    (procedure "Ftoc_FindMsg" line 57)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_FindMsg $i"
    (procedure "Ftoc_ShowSequences" line 16)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_ShowSequences $F"
    (procedure "ScanFolder" line 81)
    invoked from within
"ScanFolder inbox 0"
    invoked from within

    (procedure "Scan_Folder" line 2)
    invoked from within
"Scan_Folder $exmh(folder) $ftoc(showNew)"
    (procedure "Inc_PresortFinish" line 7)
    invoked from within
"Inc_PresortFinish"
    invoked from within
".fops.flist invoke"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]"
    (procedure "tkButtonUp" line 7)
    invoked from within
"tkButtonUp .fops.flist
"
    (command bound to event)


It seems to only happen in a folder with no unseen messages.

Chris, is this related to your recent changes?

I did not mean to insult the whole list. Users such as NoOp (who also
posts on openoffice-users) as tremendous help there. I really think
that they hold the mailing list together.

Enabling the Received headers works even better for me <wink>; here's the
f-n section from a quick run on 500-element subsets:

    0.600  0.200  won    -66.67%

A huge improvement, but for wrong reasons ... except not entirely!  The most
powerful discriminator in the whole database on one training set became:

        'received:unknown' 881 0.99

That's got nothing to do with BruceG, right?

        'received:bfsmedia.com'

was also a strong spam indicator across all training sets.  I'm jealous.

Neil, are using your own tokenizer now, or the tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize
generator?  Whichever, someone who's not afraid of their headers should try
adding mboxtest.MyTokenizer.tokenize_headers into the mix, once in lieu of
tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers(), and again in addition to it.  Jeremy
reported on just the former.

Any idea of the date of this "Hemingway Contest" claim?  Apparently

This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the "alsa-driver" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packages

Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.

Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a "one size fits all" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that "one size fits many" then if you want ;-)

Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

Matthias

PS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
since you can easily answer "freshrpms.net!" to people asking how to play
DVDs, right? ;-))))

I have been doing that as a work-around which is not ideal as it is much
slower than the PC speaker beep, especially for tab completion.  It
seems to take some time to load between successive tab key presses.

<snip>
That comment really strikes home.  We are working on a potential major
Windows desktop replacement project.  The two things that are absolutely
killing us are email and a viable substitute for Acrobat Standard.  We
can roughly mimic everything Acrobat does but only with create
complexity, taking ten times longer to get it done, using several
applications in the process, having less than comparable results, and
making the process detestable to the end users who wonder why would
anyone give up Windows for this.  There are couple of admirable efforts
out there but they have a very, very long way to go - John

Yes, that's found it!  It appears that Netbeans explicitly sets =
-Dfile.encoding=3DUTF-8 in the java command line, whereas Xcode doesn't. =
 The presence of this command option causes the problem.  By default, =
Java on Mac appears to use "MacRoman" as the file encoding.

An apparent fix in Netbeans is to go to the project's Properties > Run =
page and set the VM Options to -Dfile.encoding=3DMacRoman

At first sight, this appears to fix the problem but I need to make more =
tests to be sure; I may come back if I find further issues.   =
Incidentally, trying to set the option with a System.setProperty () call =
didn't work.

Thanks to everyone who helped

It depends.
One possible way would be to check every single application (and potentiall=

their plugins) for PIM related functionality.
I guess it is just easier to depend on runtime. These processes are run on-
demand only anyway, so in the worst case they consume disk space if nothing=

actually using PIM functionality.

I think the preconfigured threshold for database cached parts is 4KB, thoug=

there can be several such parts per item (depends on the data type).

Right, again in in the 4.4 context.
With emails these can easily be surpassed, especially on update rate (mails=
=20
come in, get marked read, moved, deleted, etc)

My take is that there is quite some room for optimizations through input by=
=20
people with good knowledge of database systems.
As far as I know the developers had help from some MySQL expert on the init=
ial=20
configuration, but since MySQL evolves over time the chosen settings might =
not=20
be that good anymore.

SQLite wasn't viable until very recently due to deadlocking when transactio=
ns=20
were being using in a multithreading environment.
My most up-to-date information on that is that it mostly works now with a=20
development version of SQLite and some additional changes elsewhere.
IIRC there is only one deadlock case left.

Performance wise it might be a viable solution for people with low=20
requirements on PIM, e.g. not for people like myself with several hundret=20
thousand mails, tens of quite active mailinglist, etc. :)

Cheers,
Kevin

Now, I run sync manually, then unplug device, and after it umount are
ran by udev. Actually there's no certain point in doing so: I can run
umount instead of sync as well. The only reason why it's done like
this is the following: I just copied this configuration from
somebody's blog and didn't modify it (well, I *almost* didn't).

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm intended to do: switch to mutt. What
news reader do you mean? Is it some kind of plugin for mutt, or is it
separate application at all? Excuse me for offtop, you can answer
privately if you want.

I'd also recommend that you check out tee and tee -a.

I don't have one on my home workstation - I do on the server, and I keep
anything important on it.  I've also found that UPSes can fail
eventually, and you might not know until the brown-out from which it
doesn't protect you.  I use ext3 on the server, which has fine
erformance for my needs.  I use the OS Which Must Not Be Named on my
workstation.

(I don't have a good reason not to have a UPS on my workstation -
basically laziness.)

As far as I know, no one at my mid-sized company has a UPS on his or
her workstation.  The expectation, again, is that important data goes
on the fileserver, although for various reasons that expectation is
not always correct.  We do have the option of requesting backups for
particular directories on our workstations, but I think they're
nightly at best.  I've actually asked about getting a UPS here and
there, but given that no one else has one and that we rarely get
brownouts, let alone blackouts, I haven't pushed the question.

I do see a lot of non-techie people using laptops as their only
computer; none of those people run linux or would recognize the term
"filesystem."  Among the techie people I know (in the US, so relatively
privileged), very few use a laptop as their primary computer; it's
usually a supplement to a beefier desktop machine.

But regardless, this is back to one of those eternal tradeoffs -
performance vs. data integrity.  I see no reason I shouldn't use a UPS
*and* a journalling filesystem when the performance of that filesystem
is adequate for my needs.

Well I have tried it multiple times and it keeps coming up with


[VT/dev/pts/0 wtopa@dj-SQUEEZE]
~$ /usr/lib/icedove/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:  8812 Segmentation fault 
     "$prog" ${1+"$@"}


When looking at that line # it does not jive with the error shown though.

Maybe something missing in Squeeze that was not included in
the depends?

Good thing I still had the old version in the archives.  :-)

Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

Making a mesh on the move

A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter Rojas

Peter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The Guardian

Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.

This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.

Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
"mesh-enabled" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.

As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.

Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.

The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.

Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.

It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.

All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.

But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.

At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.

But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.

The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.

When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

I have since solved this issue.  Apparently you can't use full version 
strings, like "1.6.0_14+", you have to use just "1.6+".  Not sure if 
that's intentional or not.  The "1.6.0_14+" string was copied correctly 
to the Info.plist file, but apparently wasn't parsed correctly?

It seems like ATTWS will offer a service that'll tell you where your friends 
(or children or spouse or whatever) are ... I haven't seen it announced, but 
from their "Explanation of Rates and Charges. "Find Friends service will only 
locate a compatible mobile device with mMode service that (1) has granted you 
permission, (2) is turned on, (3) is registered on the AT&T Wireless GSM/GPRS 
network, and (4) has not activated Be Invisible. Location services only provide 
the location...

Hah.  Speeding up transfers is more likely, since the wire is always 
the bottleneck, and compression means it will be carrying "more bits 
per bit".

Well, I'm sure you can recompile those game packages without ALSA anyway.
Also, note that ALSA 0.9.x has just appeared in Mandrake 9.0 and that all
previous Mandrake releases were using the incompatible, aging and now
unsupported 0.5.x series. (unless I've misunderstood)

Near to none, it should be quite straightforward :
http://freshrpms.net/docs/alsa/

The only tricky part is editing the /etc/modules.conf file, but the ALSA
Soundcard Matrix has a page for every supported card with a section you can
most of the time simply copy and paste!

I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never
been so easy! ;-)

Cheers,
Matthias

I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
"Permit Rajs" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

-Ian.

Probably true, but I've been living in my house maybe two years longer
than I've been in this office, and I've had fewer power problems at home
than at work.  To be fair, there haven't been many in either case.  So
as always, YMMV.

In that case there is no really meter what they have. Only you will do 
him a big favor if you put Debian because in that case they will be much 
  safer from virus's and it's much easier to open synaptic, hit refresh 
button, upgrade and apply then manually download all app. and next, 
next, next, reboot.
 From my experience it is really much easier to have Debian then Windows.
They will call you less :-)

Yes, as someone who has promoted casual use of Linux desktops for a
decade, it has been a major disappointment to see the mail struggles in
our first major foray into business desktop replacement.  Replacing
Exchange has not been a problem but replacing Outlook has been.
Honestly, the blame does not lie all in one place.  It is the
interaction between the client solutions (Kontact/Evolution) and the
Exchange replacement (Zimbra in our case).  I'm hoping we do not need to
replace Zimbra with something else that interacts better as we really do
like Zimbra and think the recent VMWare acquisition will make it even
better.  Thanks - John

<font size="-1">
A flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

The flaws could allow someone to check out every copy of every book in Adobe's new electronic library for an unlimited amount of time by changing the values in the loan form. However, the bugs were discovered on an Adobe test Web site that demonstrates how the software could be used to set up a lending library--not an actual site that offers books--and ElcomSoft gives information about how to fix the flaws.

BUSH COVERS THE WATERFRONT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but
the president has at least one other thing on his mind this
week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving,
factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and
retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing
day. 

On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to 
see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this 
isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one 
day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the
next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the
1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work
for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the
disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.

Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or
safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao
covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work
stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew 
Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly
responded that their members have been unloading military cargo
throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an
anonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion 
of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."

Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley
would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the
other hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the
increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in
polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political
danger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco 
Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll
reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the 
economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased
examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his
mind that it was hurting national security and the economy,
andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. 

As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor
disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers
simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).
One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'
contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78
days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer

THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP
-----------------------------------------------------------------
wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry "fowl." 
We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satellite
players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big
Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice
Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of
DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite 
service in the US.

The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed
merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- 
it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and
$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as 
some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,
and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV
and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?

The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold
off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice
Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified
"major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with
Justice in the next weeks.

The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those
revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies
to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted 
to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the 
cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.

TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for
investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for
expanded-service television may be nearing saturation.
TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,
"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but
shareholders may realize much smaller returns."

The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch 
waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for
DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the
current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson

					<P>It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day. </P><P>
On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax
dosages.</P><P>
Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion of
what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."</P><P>
Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the
economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. </P><P>
As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry "fowl." We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.</P><P>
The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?</P><P>
The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified "major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.</P><P>
TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, "Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."</P><P>
The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson</P><P>

 This is actually a raq3. Though, I do have an old raq2 that Liam was
helping me get netbsd on (about all you'll get on a 16MB machine these
days).

 Anyway, I wussed out, and copied hda1:/ to hda2:/boot and set the bootfs
to be hda2. It worked, though it's mounting an ext3fs as ext2. But I'm
getting there.

Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
between the five different computers and have Internet 
access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.

<p>After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.

<p>After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
here]. 

<p>Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
that he'll have a front yard left by then.

<p>The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
drive home later since they were only getting started at 
that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.

<p>The rain guage at home showed 3.25" this morning, adding 
to the 1.25" and 2.5" amounts dumped out of it within the 
last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead. 

<p>So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.

<b>Satellite Internet Delays Add Up</b>

<p><a class="url" href="http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm">http://www.skycasters.com/supervpnwhitepaper.htm</a>

<p>Have you considered moving to a satellite Internet 
provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative.

<p>Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available 
on their website.

<b>Intro to Relational Databases</b>

<p><a class="url" href="http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm">http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm</a>

<p>You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
There's a lot more to database management and development 
than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
usually results in additional work later.

<b>Smile While You Surf</b>

<p>I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default? 

<p>Cramsession.com posted some unique "excuses" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:

<ul><li><p>Roses are red
<br>Our web site is resting
<br>We're fixing the server
<br>While Everquesting

<li>In the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.

<li>Suicide note found on the web server: "I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU." 

<li>You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:

<ol><li>Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
<br><li>Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
<br><li>Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
<li>Connect the dots!
<br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.

<li>Get monitor cleaner so you can wipe ink off of screen from connecting the dots.</ol> 


<li>We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really "high tech" and "important" behind this "maintenance" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again.

<li>HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help! And I'm running out of potato chips, too!</ul>

Having an unique repository for packages that you absolutely have to
have the latest at the moment upstream makes it available is an
advantage.  Especially if you disagree with the choices or patches that
the maintainer added to package.

Both sup (sup.rubyforge.org) and notmuch (notmuchmail.org) are
interesting works-in-progress that are based off the Xapian search
engine, and have curses-based interfaces.  For people who like the gmail
interface, this might be of interest.

Even Gnome starts in seconds now. I agree, startup time is absurd,
especially with Akonadi.

It should improve for KDE 4.5. Aaron (the head Plasma dev) recently
discussed some changes to the Activities, and the possibility of
hiding the feature in 4.5 until it is mature in 4.6.

Really? Please file those crashes! I though that all the serious Kmail

Can you file a bug on that? I cannot reproduce, but I am not a Kmail
user, only occasionally test it.

With Akonadi (4.4)? I don't find it slow at all, and I'm pushing 500 contacts.

Agreed. As a non-native English speaker who knows where the term came
from, it does make me sick.

Well, the one thing that seemed quite odd to me is that you appear to be =
doing all the work in the Constructor of your class.  I would be leery =
of doing anything like that.  I don't know if that is the cause of the =
problem, but I would try moving the actual testing you want out into a =
separate method and then doing something like

   Robot1 r =3D new Robot1();
   r.doTest();

in your main method.

Were you running that command as "root" (or sudo) user?

> Password:

Uh? So it works fine for root user...

O.K., Let me check with my USB flash drive. After I plugg it:

***
sm01@stt008:~$ mount | grep fat
/dev/sdc1 on /media/disk type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal,shortname=lower,uid=1000)
***

I try to umount it:

***
sm01@stt008:~$ umount /media/disk
***

And now I verify it has been "really" umounted:

***
sm01@stt008:~$ mount | grep fat
***

Seems to be working here for my plain user.

You can check 2 more things:

- Permissions of the mounted device ("mount" will tell)

- Does this happen whith any kind of media you connect in USB ports (USB 
flash drives, media devices, etc...) or just happens with a concrete 
device?

>> - "lsof" lists the opened files, you could also check that...

There can be operations left in background that may prevent umounting the 
device... "lsof" will tell.

Hi,
1. Check do you have WiFi drivers
2. Install all what was Celejar mention. If you have KDE knetworkmanager 
is ok. In Gnome there is some Gnome variant of network manager and for 
everything else you can use Wicd.
3. Execute iwconfig to check is everything ok

Only tricky part can be driver installation if you have some evil WiFi 
card and sometimes find your router if ssid is hidden.

Troubleshooting steps depends on type of trouble. If you will have some, 
tell us.

_The Morning News_: Rosencrantz & Joshua[1]. Words fail me, which is a rare 
and pleasant gift, thank you. Instead, I will simply take this opportunity to 
quote the original _Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead_, the excellent 
play by Tom Stoppard which I keep nestled in my one remaining bookshelf[2] 
between the _Tao Te Ching_ and Roald Dahl's _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_
. 

    Guil: Exactly, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving away 
    as little as we can. It's a game.
    Ros: And then we can go?
    Guil: And receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.
    Ros: I like the sound of that. Waht do you think he meant by remembrance?
    Guil: He doesn't forget his friends.
    Ros: Would you care to estimate?
    Guil: Difficult to say, really&#8212;some kings tend to be amnesiac, others 
    I suppose&#8212;the opposite, whatever that is...
    Ros: Yes&#8212;but&#8212;
    Guil: Elephantine... ?
    Ros: Not how long&#8212;how much?
    Guil: _Retentive_&#8212;he's a very retentive king, a royal retainer...
    Ros: What are you playing at?
    Guil: Words, words. They're all we have to go on.

"Yes, and Eliza and I composed a precocious critique of the Constitution
of the United States of America, too. We argued that it was as good a
scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people
reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people
themselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend
to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong.
    We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were
blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful
friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong.
    We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not
noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human
beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves
as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no
less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same
the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday.
    Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of
the famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would,
perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect
to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally,
subdivided mankind.
    Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the
Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter
how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given
membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one
their public servants formed.
    Good for Eliza and me!
    Hi ho."

That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying "crucial hair feature" 
improves my day immeasurably.

I've done a fair amount of thinking about the "media intermediated" meeting 
thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.

I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot "interesting" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.

I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was "women, in order of attractiveness."   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....

You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say "Oh, no!  He's a geek!"   or "She's a CAT person, 
ick!" when you might have a great time together.

We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.

Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.

An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much "interview" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. 

I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of "join activities groups" is 
actually sound.

It seems reasonable to have a configurable minimum below which
spamassassin flattens the test to zero (turning it off): by default set
to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests
with scores -0.01<0<0.01 (trading accuracy for time).

The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score
* relative-time-taken) with relative-time-taken computed over a large
corpus (probably Craig's ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of
*that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing
only tests that are expensive for their utility.

Unfortunately I can't think of a good name for that parameter.

I can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.

ext2 can mount an ext3 partition, but there are
probably small changes required (to the BIOS)
to support this?

These all appear to be Oracle bugs (i.e. not Mac OS X specific), so =
here's a quick summary of what I've found and I won't post here again on =
this subject:

1) The fix for bug 6911785 in 1.6.0_20 does seem to prevent the endless =
"hang" on launch (with an active TCP/IP connection but no internet =
access), but there are still lots of problems.

2) Launching without internet access can take between 20s and 2 minutes =
based on our few tests.

3) Launching offline results in a non-sensical "this application has =
requested to go online" dialog.

4) The JNLPClassLoader ends up doing DNS lookups which occasionally =
cause long delays during execution (e.g. 20s "freeze").

There is a new bug: =
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=3D6931553 bug I think =
it only addresses part of the problem.=

It just started so I'm still trying to sort out whether it's specific
sites, javascript, etc..

javascript is turned off and that definitely seems to help.

I'm trying to figure out if it's certain sites.

of course none of this is useful until it's repeatable, hence the
reason I'm asking if their is anyone else seeing this.

Wow, if they put a VRML front end on it it would be 100% worthless rather
than just 99%

IRC...Bots....scripts.....been there done that and much better.

If these folks actualy saw the xddc instafilesharing scripts must 12 year
olds hang off of Mirc  they might get a clue, then again they might
already have teh clue that sometimes you can packege the obvious and sell

Thank you, Liam. That is why I was unable to find the KDE packages. I
thought that I may have been searching on the wrong terms, i.e. the
package is not called "kde" or "kde-desktop".

Geia sou Oresti,


If there's an API to turn-off h/w acceleration for your app context only, it
might help

Insert QuickTime in PowerPoint, Forms etc.:
http://zoomicon.com/QT4All




I have a web-service that produces static images from various sources using
Quartz.

Recently I wanted to add the capability of adding QTMovie screenshots there,
but I'm having some issues.

When the service is run by a user which currently has a graphical login, it
works fine - I can load a QTMovie, and grab a frame from a specific time to
be used in the image export.


However, in the production environment, the app is run by a user which is
not logged in. Everything else (Quartz) works fine, but QTMovie loading
bails out with this:

/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component/A
VA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011 
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component/A
VA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011 
_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the
WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component/A
VA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011 

Is there a way to work around this? I only want to get the poster image from
that movie, nothing else. I can detect in my code when I'm not connected to
the windowserver with CGGetOnlineDisplayList, so I can switch to a different
code path if required.

The Lenny kernel is configured with POSIX ACL support for ext2/3/4dev and=20
generic ACL support.  I don't think you'll need to patch the kernel, but I=

XFS is mature, fast, and well-supported by the kernel team.  If your system=
 is=20
subject to unclean shutdowns (e.g. power failure w/o a UPS), you might want=
 to=20
tune your system to flush the XFS cache to disk a bit more often than the=20
defaults.

Yes. And that's the reason why I'm trying Gnome at the moment...

Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring
administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make
things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles
into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50
times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs
18.851s).

However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project
isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess
I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for
people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after.

That's probably what I'll do if I get too antsy :)

Trying to think of ways to sneak "administrative pickle boat" into
casual conversation,

We have found that the Lenny rdestkop-1.6.0-2 package seg faults
reliably when using seamlessrdp.  In fact, it seg faults on every other
access.  Apparently this is a known problem.  We did apply the known
patch. It works and we have packaged internally as rdesktop-1.6.0-2.1.
Should we do anything with this package in case others are also using
seamlessrdp? What is the Debian protocol? Thanks - John

"of" was a typo

Unbreakable would mean here that no one, even previously authorised entity, 
could use the system without paying the periodic subscription fee.

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

Is the use of "trusted hardware" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

* EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal

The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554


BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL

Dear Chairman Powell:

I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
against DMCA-related prosecution.

EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
products were threatened by the proceedings.

When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
compromising DTV adoption itself.

As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
the Hollywood studios for review.

Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the "Open
Source" or "Free Software" movement, in which technologies are
distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
of the BPDG's "Robustness Requirements" will create and entire class
of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
licenses.

The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
was a "standard" that contained no objective criteria for legal
technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
technologies and outlaw others.

The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.

Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
they will not flock to DTV.

The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
the Internet.

Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
studio executives.

EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
looking-glass "public process" where only those participants the
organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
for their products, where the press was banned.

The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
Communications Industry Association.

Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
be of any further assistance to you.

Sincerely yours,

Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

* Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi

Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
based on the common-law tort of "trespass to chattels." ("Chattel"
is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
property in land.)

EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.

(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under "trespass to chattels"
because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.

(2) By focusing on unwanted "contact" with the chattel and ignoring
the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned "trespass to
chattels" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
"no trespassing" sign, any "contact" by a search engine could be
considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.

(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

* DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled

The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
the Motion Picture Association.

The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 
2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified 
judges to hear Johansen's case.  Now the case is scheduled to be 
heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against 
Hollywood movie studios, donate to his legal defense fund at:

* Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering

Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System

Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law

Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory

For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew "Bunnie" Huang
will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
Xbox (TM) videogame system.

Huang will present his paper, "Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
Microsoft X-BOX Case Study," at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
(CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).

The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper "shows how a
person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,"
said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. "More
importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players."

Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
withhold the paper.

"Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
publication," said Abelson. "Their response shows that they value
academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
unfettered research and publication in advancing technology."

Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
computer security.

Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
"The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
clear potential legal restraints."

"Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
getting sued," said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

* Baen Books expands fair-use-friendly e-book program

Baen Books will bind a CD-ROM into the October 2002 hardcover
edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
fair-use-friendly admonishment "This disk and its contents may be
copied and shared but NOT sold." Included on the disk are the entire
Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.

Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
employed by the blind.

Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
repealed.

Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:

You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling "Show
unseen message count in folder cache". Where is that? And in what version?
(I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)

	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
state, etc. 
	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:

XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
There was my window! 

	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:

NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE

	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
shading.)

	Hmm. Weird. 

	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)

just keep root as hda, you can change boot all you want, that's
where it will get written when you run lilo from the prompt.
just have a sane lilo.conf (with root=/dev/hda) and use lilo -b
to write to different devices.

Ben Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link 
between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. 

    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates. 

    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used. 

    Why did "they" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing. 

    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts... 

Snopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually 
largely true, albeit subject to interpretation. Link[2] Discuss[3]

uh, i wouldn't.  i was referring to the previous message which discussed
the idea of a symlink that referred to a 64 bit device id and the inode
of the file.  i gave two examples of why it wouldn't work.

yes.  i did fail to mention that floyd might not use inode 111, but
it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.

mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).

> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?

i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
situations.

The first two are wrong. The first amendment DOES
protect speech the Supreme Court decides it protects
(duh!), and that happens to include most of what
people consider hate speech. Unlike many other
nations, the US has no laws against hate speech, per
se. And the first amendment is the reason for that.

Correction: the md metadata comes after the filesystem. That's why
Grub1 doesn't see it.

Grub2 (grub-pc) can interpret md arrays and is the preferred method.

Aioanei Rares put forth on 4/15/2010 3:16 PM:

> No, it means that 2 one-gig modules in same-coloured slots will

> it works ok. Most desktop/workstation mobos do.

No, that's not correct.  If the mobo DIMM slots are colored, you put one
DIMM in each color slot for dual channel operation, not both DIMMs in the
same colored slots.

This is a very simple concept folks.  If you have two sets of train tracks
you can move twice as many trains from point A to point B in a given amount
of time.  Dual channel memory works on the same principal, doubling the
number of paths to/from memory.

Are you guys displaced Ubuntu users who landed on debian-user after a
tornado came through Kansas?  ;)

Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: "To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users." 

Offshore usability is a specific case of the general "offshore design" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. 

What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.

that not a lot of people think PHP or Lisp sucks, a lot think C++ and
Java suck, and they put Perl is somewhere in the middle. Does Perl suck
more than it use to suck, or has PHP just shot way ahead?"

0. INTRO.  [IBM DB2]
1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY.
2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE.
3. BE A SF.NET FOUNDRY GUIDE.
4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
5. SITE STATISTICS


0. INTRO

Hello SourceForge.net Users,

This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.

Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:

http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html

How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.

Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.

If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.

Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.

Pat-

Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net



1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY

SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.

Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:

Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
http://www.twtelecom.com/

University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
http://www.umn.edu/

CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/

We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
the needs of the Open Source community.

On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net



2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE

SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master
discuss such hot topics as kernel modules, virtual memory,
block I/O, database scaling, security modules, and async I/O.
You may find this audio repository at:

http://linuxkernel.foundries.sourceforge.net/article.pl?sid=02/06/26/0116225



3. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE!

Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to
code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool
projects that they think are worth downloading and testing.
A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of
choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a
foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
topic that interests you; and send email to
foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
are qualified to be a foundry guide.



4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET

We have a new position for a senior web developer available at
SourceForge.net.  We are looking for someone to help us maintain,
upgrade, and add new features to SourceForge.net.  Ideal person has
5+ years of development experience on high end, high volume
websites (3+ million page views a day).  Has a vast level of
knowledge of Internet technologies:  PHP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, DB2,
Linux, PERL, Apache, LDAP, Mailman.  A flare for design / UI is a
bonus.  SourceForge is a unique site with unique challenges.  We are
looking for someone at the top of their game.

Location of Job is in Fremont, California.  Please send resume and
URL's of sites you have worked on to jobs@sourceforge.net.  Text

EMAIL LIST REMOVAL:

When the SF.NET team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this:  "Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said "Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.


Give me bandwidth or give me death,
Elias

Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 


http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html

<<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women 
is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an 
individual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we 
find an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than 
the mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just 
one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>


As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.

Hi, I have a somewhat unusual setup at work, where I connect to an OS X 
server from a Windows PC without an X11 server installed.  I use ssh 
sessions to do the bulk of my work, and view any graphical programs 
(Aqua and X11) via vnc (so I also login to the console).  I'm the sole 
user.

I was wondering if there is a way to determine, in my ssh sessions, the 
DISPLAY environment variable that launchd provides to the console user 
(it's fine if it only works if I am the logged in user).  Without that, 
as long as I've already launched X11 from the console, I can usually set 
DISPLAY=:0.  Very rarely I've had the vnc session go "black" with the 
only recover to kill the loginwindow process (killing the vnc server 
does not help in this situation).  I don't have root so cannot reboot. 
When this happens, I can login as normal, but X11 begins to use display 
:1 even though there is no longer an X11 process running on :0.  So I 
was hoping a cleaner approach might be possible.

This is a 10.5.8 system, running X11 2.5.0.

Thanks,
Brian

I've terminated a number of my own mailing lists at yahoogroups many
months ago because of similiar sentiments. I've tried lobbying other
people to move, but with about zero success.

I've got currently only one own mailing list there, which I'm going to
move as soon as it is technically possible (which is my ISP's problem,
basically). After that, I intend to kick yahoogroups for good.

Port San Luis, California
September 05, 2002

A WHALE which suddenly breached and crashed into the bow of a
fishing boat killed a restaurant owner on board.

Jerry Tibbs, 51, of Bakersfield, California, was aboard his boat,
The BBQ, when the whale hit and tossed him into the sea five miles
off Port San Luis.

Three other fishermen stayed aboard the damaged boat, which was
towed to shore by the US Coast Guard.

Tibbs and his three friends were just ending a day fishing for
albacore when the accident occurred, authorities said.

Tibbs' body was found after a search lasting more than 18 hours
Coast Guard officials said it was the first time they could recall
an accident caused by a whale hitting a boat.

I've got an issue with a sid box that I have been maintaining for a while.
This is my workstation, and I have noticed a growing number of broken
packages, unmet dependencies and conflicts. I have been using safe-upgrade
for months now, hoping that it would work itself out over time. However,
this hasn't happened. So what can I do to fix the problems without losing
functionality? Below is the result of aptitude full-upgrade (forgive the
cut-and-paste):

Hi,
I may get my neighbor to switch to debian, if its printer works under linux, 
but it is not mentioned in  linuxprinting.org.   Has anyone some returns on 
such a  printer.(It is printer and scanner)
Thierry

"update-alternatives" output shows that the wrong java plugin version is 
being picked (openJDK instead Sun's Java one).

Mmmm, try first to setup with "update-alternatives", but in this form 
(one line):

***
update-alternatives --config firefox-javaplugin.so
***

Look if the above command let you choose between the two options and 
choose the Sun's one. 

If that does not work, you can try with the steps provided in Oracle/Sun 
site (manual way).

Hello,

I knocked all the code down to the single UI thread and I rediscovered why I need multiple threads. My Obj-C objects give KVC semantics to the bluetooth device. A getter is waiting on a thread signal for the arrival of requested data. The requested data will never arrive since the single thread is in a blocked state. I also now have to turn the bluetooth scanner off to open a connection to a discovered device!

I don't see how to do the bluetooth communications in another process be non-trivial. Is there a simple approach to that?

My next factoring will be to but the UI thread into a secondary thread, and let bluetooth own the main. Hopefully that will work.

Dave

Actually it doesn't say that they did, just that Blair spoke to

The academic discipline of Software Engineering was launched at a conference
sponsored by NATO, at Garmisch, Germany, in October, 1968. Intriguingly, the
term Software Engineering was chosen to be deliberately provocative -- why
can't software be developed with the same rigor used by other engineering
disciplines?

The proceedings of this conference are now available online, at:
http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/old/people/brian.randell/home.formal/NATO/index.html

Also, don't miss the pictures of attendees, including many significant
contributors to the field of Software Engineering:

Hi!

I had terrible issues with Snow Leopard and NetBeans 6.7.1, particularly =
doing Swing Apps. I had to do what you did, reinstalling Java 5 (An =
unsupported procedure).

NetBeans traced the bug in Apple JVM, and after NetBeans 6.8 came out =
with some workarounds for the Matisse development environment, =
everything  became usable, at least to me. So I switched completely to =
Java 6.

http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D173912

I am using Snow Leopard, Java 6, 32 bits, with 2 GiB RAM. I have not had =
mayor issues, however, I do not like the rendering (font and graphics) =
in Swing in Java 6, it looks fuzzier than Java 5.

David

Nope.  There are a few ways to deal with this; Joe mentioned a common
one, which is to have your password stored in a file that's outside of
your website directory.

Bear in mind, many, many people and businesses have successfully built
websites using both their own servers and host providers.  So for
almost any "wait, that can't be right, because it causes this
problem!" situation - there's almost certainly a readily available
solution.

Given that this is a Debian list, I should mention that Pair runs
FreeBSD systems, not Linux.

In my experience paying for web hosting - you do get what you pay for.
Pair is not the cheapest host in the business, but they have
had phenomenal uptimes, excellent support, and provide reasonable
access to the system.  I've been burned by cheap web hosts before -
including a company that cancelled a friend's account because he'd
typed "ls /etc" and they found it in his bash history file.  Wow.  I'm
not saying that you can't find a good host cheaper than Pair - for me
personally, Pair is cheap enough and good enough that I haven't looked
further since I started using them.  I should also note that I'm only
running a personal vanity site, not a business or service.  And if
you're not based in the US, I don't know how much sense it makes to
work with a US host provider.

I've never installed mysqladmin, so I can't speak to that.  I've
always just used command line tools for mySQL.

Anyway, I don't mean to sound like an advertisement for one particular
company.  I'm sure there are many reputable, reliable hosting
companies out there.  It does sound like you need a fair amount of
information to do this for the first time, so you might want to choose
a host provider that explicitly includes support as part of the deal.

Dunno, I've never used it :-?

There is a good explanation about the daemon features here:

***
Drastically Speed up your Linux System with Preload
http://techthrob.com/2009/03/02/drastically-speed-up-your-linux-system-with-preload/
***

It seems you can tweak some values but the defaults should be fine. 

Also, as per the article, you can take a look into what is currently 
monitoring by reading "/var/lib/preload/preload.state" file.

Yeah.  It certainly wasn't a solution to the Carthaginian problem or the

Not me, but IMHO it's kind of offtopic to put it in freshrpms.net RPMs. 
Upstream is the way to go...

?

Getters and setters are a bad idea, just verbosity of language. Retrieving a value from an object should be as simple as:

a := b.c

where c could be a variable or a function. You should not be able to tell. That way you can always change the implementation.

However,

b.c := <expression>

you do want the object b to check that it is valid to set c to the value of the expression. If you are not using garbage collection, you want the common idiom of reference counting statements generated for you.

Objective-C 2.0 is a great improvement in terms of you don't have to write so much junk (well, repetitive code). However, @property and @synthesize aren't exactly ideal, but just look at what you have to write without them.

Grrr... I've had that bad habit since MS-DOS 3.2

  Oops.

Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting in the other
reader hanging around forever.... not realising that never-opened-for-reading

mpeg2enc generates stats during the run, so I give each one an xterm.

What do you get with regular reportbug?  It looks like there may be
some sort of connection problem on your system.  In any event, I'd file
a bug, since the program really ought to inform the user of the problem
and terminate gracefully, rather than dump an ugly Python trackback.

Too many negatives, so I'll say it directly:

it is *smart* to use mirroring.

That is correct.  No RAID protects against user stupidity.

B. Alexander put forth on 5/14/2010 10:12 PM:
> IMHO, Debian seems to have the best record of successful upgrades.

I've in-place upgraded one of my production servers from Woody through Lenny
with only relatively minor issues.  I've been thoroughly impressed by
Debian's dist upgrade reliability since I starting using the distro in 2000.

Always read the release notes and other related docs before performing your
dist upgrade.  Failing to do so may cause unnecessary problems.

Nope.  That's for doing it yourself.

There's a lot of backports already maintained by existing DDs and DMs.  Che=

should do it.

I think it's fine, in general, just so long as no-one checks in anything
that puts it into my test corpus.

Or alternately, whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer. 
I know my mail host (interlink) runs SA, but I also run it, with my own
set of rules and scores. I don't want my spam-filter to be getting messed
up by an upstream spam filter.

Can other KDE users please triage these dataloss bugs in Korganizer in KDE 4.4:

 https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172464
 https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226394
 https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=228674
 https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236563
 https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236658

Each one should take less than a minute to triage.

Dataloss is a huge issue and I fear that it is not getting the
attention that it deserves. Hopefully if some other users confirm the
issues then the bugs will get priority. Thanks.

Too early IMO (if you mean to leave the various other tools out of
it).  If and when we package this, perhaps we should use Barry's trick
from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir
of the distribution (rather than requiring an extra directory level
just so the package can be a subdir of the distro).

Hey Folks

I know this question gets asked a lot, but I haven't seen an answer lately.

Any idea when a user will be able to view his own trust rating?   What are
the plans for this?  Will it be built into the client, web based, emailed
to you nightly?  If you could share your brainstorming on the subject, I
would greatly appreciate it.

Anyone interested in a pgp/gpg key-signing get-together @ DC,
please email me your key info (name, key ID, type, size,
fingerprint), and I will add you to the list.

If you don't have a PGP key, now is a great time to make one.

Want to find out more about PGP?
<http://www.uk.pgp.net/pgpnet/pgp-faq/>

You can get the software from:

PGPfreeware <http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgp/versions/freeware/>
GnuPG (GPG) <http://www.pgpi.org/download/gnupg/>


Bring the following:

   *  Photo ID (your name must be in your key identity)
   *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key size

I will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then
individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys.

It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from
their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key
information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID
for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then
person B can check off that person on their list.

The reverse is then done for person B.

After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked
names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a
keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the
checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using
your private key.

Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a
copy back to the key's owner to add to thier keyring.

           Summary: IMG tag based rules
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: P2
         Component: Eval Tests
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).

===============

The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of
HTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height
properties, then multiply them together and add the result to the
running total.

Spam % of all rules with S/O > 0.90: 31.25%

=========================

I figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only
have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
consecutive IMGs within a message.

This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.

Spam % of all rules with S/O > 0.90: 22.85%

==========================

Next I'm going to see if there's any meta rules I can make that will
reduce the FP rate for low S/O rules.

I'm assuming I need to strip the SpamAssassinReport.txt attachments 
from my spam mailbox before I run the mailbox through razor-report, 
correct?  Does anyone know of an easy way to do this?

Thanks

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll.  The .exes are cmdline programs.  One is a POP3 proxy.  If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.  In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and "all it does" is
insert a

    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and "do
something about it" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much <wink>).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

Well, just to take this thread off topic - does anyone know what's 
involved in serving streaming video? I assume that
 the only practical alternatives are MS and Real, and that it's likely 
to cost some $$$ for the software.

I tried also with --revision, e.g.,

fakeroot make-kpkg --revision=lore01 --initrd 
--append-to-version=-recompiled kernel-image kernel-headers

but I cannot seem to get rid of that +drm33.1 string:

linux-headers-2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled_2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled-10.00.Custom_i386.deb

they do not seem to be set:

$ grep VERSION .config
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=""
# CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO is not set

Well you are right, sorry, I didn't have any better idea yesterday late in
the evening.
The fonts are ugly only inside of gnome2 and clean for gnome1 apps, if
antialiasing is disabled. 
This is difficult to understand for me.

     New $199 PC Doesn't Do Windows

By MATTHEW FORDAHL
AP Technology Writer
  
  It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts
have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.
  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.
  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,
runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has
been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away
from the Microsoft monopoly.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
removed.  (I think.)

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
are actually reread from disk.


My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
investigate that.

    Yeah, I need to work this out, too; I just learned my lesson about living on the bleeding edge. Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.

    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.

    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  "apt-get dist-upgrade" dumps core.

    What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?

*Political spam on your cell phone?*
By Lisa M. Bowman <mailto:lisa.bowman@cnet.com>
Special to ZDNet News
August 22, 2002, 12:05 PM PT
URL: http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-954909.html 
<%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1105-954909.html%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20> 


*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 
who funded them.*

In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 
information won't be required.

The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 
political spam.

Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.

Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 
groups.

FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 
potential to reach more voters.

"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 
everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.

Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 
messages while remaining anonymous.

Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.

Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 
"good for America."

"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 
for office," he said. "We have free speech on our side."

hello Camaleon,

That was it: I used the GNOME shutdown dialog: I thought it would call
hibernate?

When I use hibernate, I get this log:

Starting suspend at Mo 26. Apr 09:00:05 CEST 2010

=> so it seems to work. Still I got an error message and hangup
concerning uvcvideo on resume a few days ago, but unfortunately I don't
have the error message around.

Thank you for your help! Maybe the problem is fixed by using
/usr/sbin/hibernate.

In my experience, this is classic "American" behaviour, and I don't

1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change 
   folder" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   hit a second + and you go to "set a target" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

How's spring shaping up "down under"?

Hi

I have a hp mini, which has a 0:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel
Corporation Mobile 945GME Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)

I would like to know how I can force ttyX to go to the external monitor and
then back to the local lcd.

Also have a problem that if I have my X going to an external monitor and
then suspend and re awaken with the laptop not connected to an external
monitor I can't get my X session back I have to restart gdm.

[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the 
article I was commenting on... Rohit]

In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week ("The 
Search Goes On", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.

The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
the article.

Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
of the Web?

To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.

On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...

Best,
   Rohit Khare

===========================================================

The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Googleóup to a point

Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition

IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
is gougou, meaning ìdoggyî. For the country's fast-growing population of 
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaóapparently 
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
restored.

An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.

After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
to far less powerful search engines in China.

Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this 
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on 
Google for Falun Gongóa quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in Chinaó
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search 
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

cpan, it worked.  With the help of others, got razor working.  I did however 
notice something in my logs which happened twice but hasn't recurred.

"MIAMI, Sept. 10 -- A two-gram rock of crack
cocaine was found inside the shoe of Florida
Gov. Jeb Bush's 25-year-old daughter by workers
at the central Florida rehabilitation center
where she is undergoing court-ordered drug
treatment, Orlando police said today.

Noelle Bush was not arrested because witnesses
would not give sworn statements, but the
incident is under investigation, according to
Orlando police spokesman Orlando Rolon."

Wow, the witnesses would not nark of a Bush girl in an era where there are
no mare restrictions on being held without a cause?

Imagine that...

Of course. What we need is an anonymous betting pool on prominent 
spammer's time of demise. Unfortunately, the government tends to take a 
dim view of this, for some unfathomable reason.

Uh, account revokation doesn't have quite the same level of deterrence as 
cranial indentation with a heavy, blunt object. Honestly, how many people 
will still spam if they knew they'd be running a real risk of losing life 
and limb?

Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU
is probably working.

The Beer Scooter 

How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night
drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you
try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to
your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer
Scooter.

The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased
to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched
out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and
has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter
works in the following fashion:-

The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the
"slurring gland" begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of
his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a
winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits
them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is
not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket
cash is taken as payment.

This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend
so much money?'

Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are
thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified
Drinking Injuries).  An undocumented feature of the beer scooter
is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of
Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly
unaccounted for.

This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell
happened?'

With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of
Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes,
in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately
one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and
quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of
time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often
cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending
the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences.
With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in
a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and
pizza crusts.

Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come
equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and
Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in
such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs,
you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity
springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the
CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised
shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some
scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how
one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a
single night.

PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably
get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a
T-shirt.

This I would guess is normal, but don't you get it at the very beginning of
the build? Isn't this at the end just a reminder?

Argh, I forgot to exclude aaxine from the %files when using "--without
aalib" :-(
The current "fr6.1" spec file fixes this...

Great! Thanks! Just what I was looking for.

What would be the simplest command to achieve this key extraction and
insertion? In my case, his key is already on my keyring, so I have some
difficulty testing any command that I'd think up myself.

Whether Akonadi works or not appears to be a game of roulette to me.=20
=46reshly since upgrading from KDE 4.4.3:

Bug 236535 -  sometimes can't open and log timezone and privilege tables
https://bugs.kde.org/236535

Bug 236538 -  often does not find resource agents on first start of Kontact
https://bugs.kde.org/236538

Bug 236539 -  dbus session bus not available on first start of Kontact -=20
race condition?
https://bugs.kde.org/236539

I already grepped in ~/.local/share/contacts for contact information as=20
Akonadi was not available and I didn't now it would be there when I start=20
kontact again.

My address book as to be accessible *all of the time* without bombarding=20
me with more and less cryptic error messages. There are about 15 self=20
tests that might fail. I think Akonadi from KDE 4.4 depends on too many=20
external factors that it just can't control fully.

But nonetheless: I think these issues should be fixed upstream. And I also=
=20
don't what else Debian developers could do then to use KDEPIM from KDE 4.4=
=20
if the freeze will really happen this summer. Shipping KDEPIM 4.3 with KDE=
=20
4.4 might not be an option for Debian KDE developers, cause it abandoned=20
by upstream already and all security fixes needs to be backported. Sure=20
when KDE 4.5 is out the same happens to KDE 4.4, but at least it will=20
contain the security and other fixes upto then.=20

So either KDE project decides to fix any Akonadi related issues for KDE 4.4=
=20
series or Debian extends freeze. Other options would be: Shipping a KDE=20
4.5 backport or even Squeeze + 1 shortly afterwards.

Ciao,
=2D-=20
